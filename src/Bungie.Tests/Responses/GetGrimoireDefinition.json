I could be older than you, Tibon!<br/>\n/ True. The gardbrace is fine now. Stop worrying at it. Will you take the Jigoku?<br/>\n/ Thought I&#39;d take the long rifle. Bayle has the Jigoku.<br/>\n/ Good. That Ghost - what do you think is wrong with it? It&#39;s echoing something ancient, an Old Earth language. You know what that Ghost reminds me of, flitting about over there? <br/>\n/ I don&#39;t.<br/>\n/ The time Ghosts from Jagi&#39;s Host came back without them. Remember - they got in that fight at some point east of the Caspian? Seven Ghosts, damn near silent, buzzing with some sort of corruption. Drifting back to the Tower, one by one. Scared the Speaker well enough. <br/>\n/ I remember. A long time ago. Jagi tells the story differently.<br/>\n/ Well. We all grow old. In our way. Little Ghost! Come back here!<br/>\n/ It&#39;s not going to make it, wherever it&#39;s going.<br/>\n/ I want to talk to it. Little Ghost! <br/>\n/ Lyssa and Bayle are probably there already. <br/>\n/ Cabal move slowly. We&#39;ve got time. <br/>\n/ But the Warlocks have had a vision.<br/>\n/ Yes. That new one, what&#39;s her name. Ingora?<br/>\n/ Ikora.<br/>\n/ She&#39;s always been hasty. I&#39;ve faced these Cabal before.

Down below the Ishtar ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is alone on the rock. She goes on with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse meteor.<br/><br/>\nThe message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the Cinders it said. Is it true? <br/><br/>\nAnd also: Remember your promise.<br/><br/>\nAt dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds gas. She takes its post and lays out her bullets one by one on the rock as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her rifle is near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them to kill the other sentries one by one until at last they understand the thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders below to seek her out.<br/><br/>\nShe leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.<br/><br/>\nThe stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!<br/><br/>\nShe kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance.

Who hasn&#39;t spent a dozen years scouring the ruins for one string of symbols, one clean code, one black talon. Titans just make a hmphing noise, if they&#39;ve stayed awake. Hunters clean their nails with their knives and look at you like you&#39;ve grown a third eye.<br/><br/>\nBut when you&#39;ve spent your life searching through arcana for ancient power, you have the urge to reach out and educate others. Especially if you&#39;ve had one too many.<br/><br/>\nNah, she&#39;s not my type at all. We&#39;ve played dice, cards, war games, you know, the usual stuff. I&#39;d never tried to show off before. I don&#39;t know what came over me.<br/><br/>\nI had a broken vertebrae in my pocket that I&#39;d borrowed from - yes, borrowed, I was going to put it back - what do you think you are, my conscience? It was a fossil, that means mineral replacement, a rock, basically. They can survive a few hours in my pocket. Do shut up.<br/><br/>\nThe Cryptarchs weren&#39;t going to miss it. Everyone knows the Ahamkaras were hunted to extinction. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of anymore.<br/><br/>\nThink of how mysterious this system is, I said. How much life sprang up when the Traveler came. Like the Ahamkara. Do you know the legends? The dragon that made promises? And I pulled out the fossil with a flourish - <br/><br/>\nShe pulled out her knife and started to pick the dirt from her nails. That set me off.<br/><br/>\nYou could never have brought down one of these, I said. Ever. Not the greatest Hunter, not the brawniest Titan.<br/><br/>\nHer eyes narrowed. She said, Oh? Is that so? And I saw right then that she wasn&#39;t going to pass on the challenge.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;ve murdered a Guardian, I thought. She&#39;s going to die. It&#39;ll be my fault.<br/><br/>\nAnd I looked at the piece of spine in my hand and wondered - why did I say that? What moved me to such pride?",

Historians will read this diary, but it won&#39;t take their insight to tell the world that I&#39;m terrified.

Because it&#39;s who we are.<br/><br/>\nNow we go because we have to. Because the unknown came to us.

A twenty minute round-trip lightspeed delay to Earth meant we could only count on ourselves.<br/><br/>\nWhen the number three engine went diagnostic during the second course correction, I thought we might go catastrophic.<br/><br/>\nBut Qiao brought us in. Mihaylova brought us in. I just flew the ship.<br/><br/>\nThe Ares One excursion vehicle was built for thin winds and icy dust. We came down into a storm: the breath of God, a ripple of change rolling down off the artifact. We aborted on three sites and finally I took us into powered hover and brought us down on reflexes and instinct.<br/><br/>\nThen we ran the checklists, suited up, and left the vehicle.<br/><br/>\nThere was a script, and it&#39;s true, I botched it. I got my boots down and I made the most famous gaffe in human history. Said the first thing that came to mind: a warning to the others.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re walking into a rising wind.&quot;<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to say anything immortal.

And there’s no place for fatigue to latch onto me.”<br/><br/>\nBut shame is a different affliction.<br/><br/>\nI’m a soldier.  I was forged by other hands and forced into the role of warrior.  According to my scars, I fought and fought.  Besides bits and flashes, every battle has been forgotten.  But I have this clear, awful sense that others died.  In my unit, every soldier was killed except for me.  Yet despite a thousand chances to be shredded and scrapped, here I stood, no weapon in my hands, making fists out of habit but with nothing to hit.<br/><br/>\nI’d fought to save the Earth.  That was my sense of things.  But our world was collapsing around us, and every soul was doomed.  Even cockroaches and microbes would die.  And being an expert in the art of losing battles, I saw no ending to this battle but another loss.<br/><br/>\nAnd I was ashamed.<br/><br/>\nThe shame took hold of me.  It shook me.  Shame stole my mass and my resolve.  Suddenly I felt like a feather, like a breath, like any small nothing ready to be lost in the first breeze.<br/><br/>\nBut in the midst of that despair, a fresh thought took hold.<br/><br/>\nI was cursed.<br/><br/>\nAnd do you know what a curse is?<br/><br/>\nIt is stubborn.  A curse delivered by the gods will hold you when everything else has given up on you.  And it was obvious that survival was my eternal curse.  A thousand battles and how many were won?  Judging by the evidence, none.  And that’s why the shame was chewing at my ceramic guts.  But despite the horrific losses, I had endured.<br/><br/>\nClosing my eyes, I forced my fists to open.<br/><br/>\n“This isn’t over,” I said.  To this enemy, to myself.

Five? I like seven better. What I&#39;m recalling is a giant star with a family of six smaller suns, and you could spend days and nights counting all of the planets circling those suns...except there are no planets. Not anymore. The powers in charge have carved up all of the worlds, and maybe a brown dwarf or two for good measure. With that rubble, they fashioned a topologically creative enclosure, a twisting of space and time sealed behind doors that admit only those who know the magic words. The bones of a hundred planets have been cut smooth and laid out like a floor, a polished and lovely floor creating vast living spaces. A floor bigger than ten thousand worlds, catching the fierce glory of the seven suns. For light, for food. For beauty. And nothing escapes. Not heat, not gravity. Not even the faintest proud sound.<br/><br/>\nIt could be anywhere. It can live in the cold between galaxies, or folded up inside matter, near enough to touch right now...<br/><br/>\nI remember it and maybe it&#39;s exactly as I describe it. Seven suns wrapped inside magic. Or it&#39;s something else entirely, perhaps. A place still fat with life. An abundance of sentient souls, some decent, maybe a few of lesser quality, and everybody stands about or floats about, or they bounce between dimensions. The point is that the residents of this hidden realm live inside a bottle so perfectly hidden that they can&#39;t see beyond their own borders. Which shapes a mind in very specific ways.<br/><br/>\nBut, Beyond is their name for a mysterious, doubtful realm that they can&#39;t see.<br/><br/>\nWhich is us, of course.",

That a lost Guardian’s weapon was altered by the Hive in an attempt to fuse their own dark understanding with humanity’s mastery of war. The result was a weapon that would feed on its owner’s aggression—reaching further when angry eyes drew focus, its hunger rising as it tore through bone and flesh.<br/><br/>\nAny Guardian who comes across the weapon must ask some very simple questions with endlessly complicated answers: Is your Light bright enough to stand, even briefly, in full gaze of the Hive&#39;s abyss? Can it handle what has died and been reborn in those shadows?",

The facts won&#39;t sync with the reality, but they&#39;ll be close, and there&#39;s no one to say otherwise, so for all intents and purposes, this will be the history of a settlement we called Palamon and the horrors that followed an all too brief peace.<br/><br/>\nI remember home, and stories of a paradise we&#39;d all get to see some day - of a City, &quot;shining even in the night.&quot; Palamon didn&#39;t shine, but it was sanctuary, of a sort. <br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d settled in the heart of a range that stretched the horizon. Wooded mountains that shot with purpose toward the sky. Winters were harsh, but the trees and peaks hid us from the world. We talked about moving on, sometimes, striking out for the City. But it was just a longing.<br/><br/>\nDrifters came and went. On occasion they would stay, but rarely. <br/>\nWe had no real government, but there was rule of law. Basic tenets agreed upon by all and eventually overseen by Magistrate Loken.<br/><br/>\nAnd there you have it...no government, until there was. I was young, so I barely understood. I remember Loken as a hardworking man who just became broken. Mostly I think he was sad. Sad and frightened. As his fingers tightened on Palamon, people left. Those who stayed saw our days became grey. Loken&#39;s protection - from the Fallen, from ourselves - became dictatorial. <br/><br/>\nLooking back, I think maybe Loken had just lost too much - of himself, his family. But everyone lost something. And some of us had nothing to begin with. My only memory of my parents is a haze, like a daydream, and a small light, like the spark of their souls. It&#39;s not anything I dwell on. They left me early, taken by Dregs.<br/><br/>\nPalamon raised me from there. The family I call my own - called my own - cared for me as if I was their natural born son. And life was good. Being the only life I knew, my judgment is skewed, and it wasn&#39;t easy - pocked by loss as it was - but I would call it good.<br/><br/>\nUntil, of course, it wasn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nUntil two men entered my world. One a light. The other the darkest shadow I would ever know.",

								"cardDescription" : "The man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, my third father and quite possibly my closest friend, came to Palamon from the south.<br/><br/>\nI was just a boy, but I&#39;ll never forget his silhouette on the empty trail as he made his slow walk into town.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d never seen anything like him. Maybe none of us had. He&#39;d said he was only passing through, and I believed him - still do, but life can get in the way of intent, and often does.<br/><br/>\nI can picture that day with near perfect clarity. Of all the details though - every nuance, every moment - the memory that sticks in my mind is the iron on Jaren&#39;s hip. A cannon that looked both pristine and lived in. Like a relic of every battle he&#39;d ever fought, hung low at his waist - a trophy and a warning.<br/><br/>\nThis man was dangerous, but there was a light about him - a pureness to his weight - that seemed to hint that his ire was something earned, not carelessly given.<br/><br/>\nI&#39;d been the first to see him as he approached, but soon most of Palamon had turned out to greet him. My father held me back as everyone stood in silence.<br/><br/>\nJaren didn&#39;t make a sound behind his sleek racer&#39;s helmet. He looked just like the heroes in the stories, and to this day I&#39;m not sure one way or the other if the silence between the town&#39;s people and the adventurer was born of fear or respect. I like to think the latter, but any truth I try to place on the moment would be of my own making.<br/><br/>\nAs we waited for Magistrate Loken to arrive and make an official greeting, my patience got the best of me. I shook free of my father&#39;s heavy hand and made the short sprint across the court, stopping a few paces from where this new curiosity stood - a man unlike any other.<br/><br/>\nI stared up at him and he lowered his attention to me, his eyes hidden behind the thick tinted visor of his headgear. My sight quickly fell to his sidearm. I was transfixed by it. I imagined all the places that weapon had been. All of the wonders it had seen. The horrors it had endured. My imagination darted from one heroic act to the next.<br/><br/>\nI barely registered when he began to kneel, holding out the iron as if an offering. But my eyes locked onto the piece, mesmerized. <br/><br/>\nI recall turning back to my father and seeing the looks on the faces of everyone I knew. There was worry there - my father slowly shaking his head as if pleading with me to ignore the gift. <br/><br/>\nI turned back to the man I would come to know as Jaren Ward, the finest Hunter this system may ever know and one of the greatest Guardians to ever defend the Traveler&#39;s Light...<br/><br/>\nAnd I took the weapon in my hand. Carefully. Gently.<br/><br/>\nNot to use. But to observe. To imagine. To feel its weight and know its truth.<br/><br/>\nThat was the first time I held &quot;Last Word,&quot; but, unfortunately, not the last.",

								"cardDescription" : "It was the fourth night of the seventh moon.<br/><br/>\nNine rises since any sign.<br/><br/>\nTrail wasn&#39;t cold, but lukewarm would&#39;ve been an exaggeration.<br/><br/>\nJaren had us hold by a ravine.<br/><br/>\nThe heavy wood along the cliffs&#39; edge caught the wind, holding back the cold and the rush of water muffled our conversation.<br/><br/>\nWe&#39;d seen dual Skiffs hanging low as they cut through the valley.<br/><br/>\nWasn&#39;t known Fallen territory, but anymore that&#39;s a dangerous assumption.<br/><br/>\nThere were six of us then.<br/><br/>\nThree less than two moons prior, but still, one more than when we&#39;d first turned our backs to Palamon&#39;s ash.<br/><br/>\nWe took a rotation for watch during the night.<br/><br/>\nMovement was kept to a minimum and communication was down to hand signals and simple gestures.<br/><br/>\nWe could hold our own in a fight, but only the dead went looking for one—a hard truth that cut in direct opposition to our reasons for being so far from anything resembling civilization, much less our safety.<br/><br/>\nThe Skiffs had spooked Kressler and Nada, and, in truth, me as well. But, looking back, I think we were all just grasping for any good reason to turn back.<br/><br/>\nNot because we would—turn back—but because it seemed to be our only real hope, and I think we all knew it.<br/><br/>\nForward. Where we were headed—into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.<br/><br/>\nJaren never wavered though. Not once.<br/><br/>\nAt least not to any noticeable degree.<br/><br/>\nIt was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.<br/><br/>\nAnd—it&#39;s hard to think on—but if I&#39;m honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire. A fire that was all but exhausted on that cold night.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed confident we were close.<br/><br/>\nBut more than confident—sure. He seemed sure.<br/><br/>\nNo one else felt it—our own confidence, and any enthusiasm we&#39;d had was set to wither soon as Brevin, Trenn and Mel were gunned down.<br/><br/>\nThe Ghost—Jaren&#39;s Ghost—never said a word to any of us. Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.<br/><br/>\nI never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.<br/><br/>\nWe knew it could speak. We&#39;d overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.<br/><br/>\nFrom time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back—taking in the arm&#39;s length at which he kept the others—I guess I should&#39;ve known, or at least suspected there was more to it.<br/><br/>\nWe all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.<br/><br/>\nA crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.<br/><br/>\nFar off, but near enough to pump the blood.<br/><br/>\nA familiar ring. &quot;Last Word.&quot; Jaren&#39;s sidearm. His best friend.<br/>\nThen another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.<br/><br/>\nOne shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.<br/><br/>\nWe crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.<br/><br/>\nJaren was gone. Off on his own.<br/><br/>\nMaybe we were closer than we&#39;d allowed ourselves to believe.<br/><br/>\nToo close.<br/><br/>\nHe&#39;d gone to face death alone.<br/><br/>\nI couldn&#39;t admit it—not at the time—but he thought he was <br/>\nprotecting us.<br/><br/>\nAfter such a long road—years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire—maybe he just couldn&#39;t take the thought of anymore dead &quot;kids,&quot; as he called us.<br/><br/>\nThe echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.<br/><br/>\nWhat was done was done.<br/><br/>\nThe cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Last Word&quot; it hadn&#39;t been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.<br/><br/>\nHours passed. An eternity.<br/><br/>\nWe held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.<br/><br/>\nBy midday I was alone. I couldn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t.<br/><br/>\nEither I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.<br/><br/>\nDeath marching on.<br/><br/>\nBut then, a motion. Quick and darting. My muscles tensed and my hand shot to the grip of my leadslinger.<br/><br/>\nThen a confirmation of the horrible truth I had already accepted, as Jaren&#39;s Ghost came to a halt a few paces in front of me.<br/><br/>\nI exhaled and slumped forward. Still standing, but broken.<br/>\nThe tiny Light looked me over with a curious tilt to its axis, then shot a beam of light over my body. Scanning me as it had done the very first time we met.<br/><br/>\nI looked up. Staring into its singular glowing eye.<br/><br/>\nAnd it spoke...",

Tracking Fallen, after the bandits had caused a stir.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger – the other – arrived the following day.<br/><br/>\nHe rarely spoke. Took a room. Took our hospitality.<br/><br/>\nI was intrigued by him, as I was Jaren when he’d first arrived.<br/><br/>\nBut the stranger was cold. Distant. Damaged, I thought.<br/><br/>\nBut I wasn’t afraid. Not yet.<br/><br/>\nOnly a child, I knew the monsters of our world to walk like men, but they were not. They were something alien. Four-armed and savage.<br/><br/>\nThe stranger was polite, but solemn.<br/><br/>\nI took him for a sad, broken man, and he was. Though, at the time, I didn’t understand how that could make one dangerous.<br/><br/>\nAs with Jaren, father made an effort to keep me away from the stranger.<br/><br/>\nIt wouldn’t matter.<br/><br/>\nAs the silhouette approached, fear held tight.<br/><br/>\nThe dark figure towered over me. Looking into me – through me.<br/><br/>\nHe smiled. My knees weak. All lost.<br/><br/>\nThen, he turned and walked away.<br/><br/>\nLeaving ruin and a heartbroken, terrified boy in his wake without a second glance.<br/><br/>\nI’ve been chasing that stranger’s shadow ever since.<br/><br/><br/><i>Now.</i><br/><br/>\nWe stood silent, the sun high.<br/><br/>\nSeconds passed, feeling more like hours.<br/><br/>\nHe looked different.<br/><br/>\nHe seemed, now, to be weightless – effortless in an existence that would crush a man burdened by conscience.<br/><br/>\nMy gaze remained locked as I felt a heat rising inside of me.<br/>\nThe other spoke...<br/><br/>\n“Been awhile.”<br/><br/>\nI gave no reply.<br/><br/>\n“The gunslinger’s sword... his cannon. That was a gift.”<br/><br/>\nMy silence held as my thumb caressed the perfectly worn hammer at my hip.<br/><br/>\n“An offering from me... to you.”<br/><br/>\nThe heat grew. Centered in my chest.<br/><br/>\nI felt like a coward the day Jaren Ward died and for many cycles after.<br/><br/>\nBut here, I felt only the fire of my Light.<br/><br/>\nThe other probed...<br/><br/>\n“Nothing to say?”<br/><br/>\nHe let the words hang.<br/><br/>\n“I’ve been waiting for you. For this day.”<br/><br/>\nHis attempt at conversation felt mundane when judged against all that had come before.<br/><br/>\n“Many times I thought you’d faltered. Given up...”<br/><br/>\nAll I’d lost, all who’d suffered, flashed rapid through my mind, intercut with a dark silhouette walking toward a frightened, weak, coward of a boy.<br/><br/>\nThe fire burned in me.<br/><br/>\nThe other continued...<br/><br/>\n“But here you are. This is truly an end...”<br/><br/>\nAs his tongue slipped between syllables my gun hand moved as if of its own will.<br/><br/>\nReflex and purpose merged with anger, clarity and an overwhelming need for just that... an end.<br/><br/>\nIn step with my motion, the fire within burst into focus – through my shoulder, down my arm – as my finger closed on the trigger of my third father’s cannon.<br/><br/>\nTwo shots. Two bullets engulfed in an angry glow. <br/>\nThe other fell.<br/><br/>\nI walked to his corpse. He never raised his cursed Thorn – the jagged gun with the festering sickness.<br/><br/>\nI looked down at the dead man who had caused so much death.<br/><br/>\nMy shooter still embraced by the dancing flames of my Light.<br/>\nA sadness came over me.<br/><br/>\nI thought back to my earliest days. Of Palamon. Of Jaren.<br/><br/>\nLeveling my cannon at the dead man’s helm, I paid one final tribute to my mentor, my savior, my father and my friend...<br/><br/>\n“Yours... Not mine.”<br/><br/>\n...as I closed my grip, allowing Jaren’s cannon, now my own, to have the last, loud word.",

And his aura burned bright.<br/><br/>\nWhen the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his wake hope spread. But the man had a secret fear. His thoughts were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had been a hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow&#39;s road.<br/><br/>\nSlowly the shadows&#39; whisper became a voice, a dark call, offering glories enough to make even the brightest Light wander. He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.<br/><br/>\nOn his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a fleeting hope - though they would suffer for the man he would become, the people would remember him as he had been.<br/><br/>\nAnd so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh should touch, and gave up his mortal self to claim a new birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known only to fate.<br/><br/>\nIn that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the noble man ceased to exist. In his place another stood. <br/><br/>\nSame meat. Same bone. But so very different.<br/><br/>\nThe first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last descendent of the name Yor.<br/><br/>\nIn his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose and realized for the first time that it held no petals: only the jagged purpose of angry thorns.",

It’s who I was that’s gone.<br/>\n[u.1:1.4] Who you were held all the value.<br/>\n[u.2:1.5] To you.<br/>\n[u.1:1.5] To the Light.<br/>\n[u.2:1.6] The Light...<br/>\n[u.1:1.6] It is all.<br/>\n[u.2:1.7] It is nothing but a crutch.<br/>\n[u.1:1.7] One that has held you up.<br/>\n[u.2:1.8] Only just. And nothing more.<br/>\n[u.1:1.8] Nothing more? You were a hero.<br/>\n[u.2:1.9] And yet people still die. Corruption still exists. Light still fades. And Darkness still spreads.<br/>\n[u.1:1.9] As it will ever be, that doesn’t mean you give in to...<br/>\n[u.2:2.0] To what? Hope.<br/>\n[u.1:2.0] This is not hope.<br/>\n[u.2:2.1] This is peace.<br/>\n[u.1:2.1] You have blood on your hands.<br/>\n[u.2:2.2] How’s that any different than prior?<br/>\n[u.1:2.2] Innocent blood.<br/>\n[u.2:2.3] Matter of perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:2.3] That’s the shadow talking.<br/>\n[u.2:2.4] And am I not.<br/>\n[u.1:2.4] The shadow?<br/>\n[u.2:2.5] Ya know... These past cycles, you’ve made an honorable effort. Tried your best to correct my course. But I don’t know it needs correcting.<br/>\n[u.1:2.5] And if it does?<br/>\n[u.2:2.6] Could be too late.<br/>\n[u.1:2.6] &#39;Could be&#39; is a winding path.<br/>\n[u.2:2.7] Long way from where I was to where I’m going.<br/>\n[u.1:2.7] That is my hope. That there is still time.<br/>\n[u.2:2.8] For?<br/>\n[u.1:2.8] Corrective measures. The righting of our path. The cleansing of your shadow and a return to the Light.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:2.9] Why’d you pick me?<br/>\n[u.1:2.9] It doesn’t work that way.<br/>\n[u.2:3.0] Was I special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.0] You were.<br/>\n[u.2:3.1] But only as special as any other.<br/>\n[u.1:3.1] You are all special.<br/>\n[u.2:3.2] Seems to contradict the word don’t it.<br/>\n[u.1:3.2] Not in my estimation.<br/>\n[u.2:3.3] If we’re all special, are any of us special?<br/>\n[u.1:3.3] Is that what you want? To be special?<br/>\n[u.2:3.4] Heh.<br/>\n[u.1:3.4] You dismiss, but it’s a very serious question. Is that all you’re after? Is all of the death worth that badge?<br/>\n[u.2:3.5] Am I not already more than the rest?<br/>\n[u.1:3.5] Looking at you here, now. The smoke, ash and bone at your feet mark you as so much less.<br/>\n[u.2:3.6] Maybe. And yet here you are.<br/>\n[u.1:3.6] Meaning?<br/>\n[u.2:3.7] You have been at my side every step of the way.<br/>\n[u.1:3.7] Where else would I be?<br/>\n[u.2:3.8] Yet you disagree so thoroughly with my change in perspective.<br/>\n[u.1:3.8] If only the change was simply one of perspective. Your “evolution” was no choice. This is not you having come to an understanding after careful considered thought. This is corruption.<br/>\n[u.2:3.9] The shadows?<br/>\n[u.1:3.9] The Darkness.<br/>\n[u.2:4.0] Maybe so.<br/>\n[u.1:4.0] There is no maybe here.<br/>\n[u.2:4.1] And you think you can save me?<br/>\n[u.1:4.1] I rekindled your Light, it falls first to me to aid in its survival.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.2] I tire of it.<br/>\n[u.1:4.2] You must try...<br/>\n[u.2:4.3] I tire of you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.3] [REDACTED]...<br/>\n[u.2:4.4] That is no longer my name.<br/>\n[u.1:4.4] I will not speak the other.<br/>\n[u.2:4.5] It doesn’t matter. This is where we part ways.<br/>\n[u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.<br/>\n[u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.<br/>\n[u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead will be more than any one Guardian can handle.<br/>\n[u.2:4.7] That’s the point. It’s been sometime since you saw me as worthy of walking among those I once called brother and sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am worthy of so much more.<br/>\n[u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.<br/>\n[u.2:4.8] Someday. Won’t be the first time.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I am releasing you of the burden of my deeds, both done and yet to come.<br/>\n[u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light from your shell and leave the carcass of my first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red world for no one to find.<br/>\n[u.1:4.9] Then I’ve failed you, completely.<br/>\n[u.2:5.1] Not me. Maybe the man I was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.0] He is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.2] I believe so.<br/>\n[u.1:5.1] Belief is not fact.<br/>\n[u.2:5.3] Semantics I no longer have the patience for.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:5.4] When you speak of me, use my proper name. Tell them of the man that stands before you, not the ghost of the hero I once was.<br/>\n[u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to me.<br/>\n[u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you will forever taint his legacy. All the good I have ever done will be washed away in the fire of who I have become.<br/>\n[u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some promise within you.<br/>\n[u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to give hope to the frightened, huddled masses so that when I come upon them they will have more to lose. Their pain will be greater. Their screams more pure. <br/>\n[u.1:5.4] You...<br/>\n[u.2:5.7] Nothing dies like hope. I cherish it. <br/>\n[u.1:5.5] You’re a monster.<br/>\n[u.2:5.8] Finally, you see the truth.<br/>\n[u.1:5.6] [REDACTED] is truly dead.<br/>\n[u.2:5.9] So I’ve said. Long live Dredgen Yor.<br/>\n[u.1:5.7] This is farewell, but you can only run from your sins so far. In the end, you will die alone.<br/>\n[u.2:6.0] Maybe so. But I gotta tell ya... I tend to like my odds.<br/>\n[u.1:5.8] Your tainted “Rose” will not always save you.<br/>\n[u.2:6.1] Old friend... It already has.",

You may not see it – for lack of looking, or blind ignorance – but I am all that is good.<br/>\n[u.1:0.8] You’ve just murdered a good man.<br/>\n[u.2:0.8] He shot first.<br/>\n[u.1:0.9] Yet you stand.<br/>\n[u.2:0.9] Guess he missed.<br/>\n[u.1:1.0] He never misses.<br/>\n[u.2:1.0] First time for everything.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:1.1] His cannon? Nice piece of hardware.<br/>\n[u.2:1.2] Well-worn, but clean.

You’re feeding his anger.<br/>\n[u.2:3.0] The gun is a memento, nothing more.<br/>\n[u.1:2.8] You claim to be a vessel, a hollow shell where once a man stood, but that is just a lie.

No force of nature would play such games.<br/>\n[u.2:3.3] Games?<br/>\n[u.1:3.1] The cannon. You wish to tempt the boy. To spur him on and fuel his rage. There is intent there. The actions of a man, monstrous, mad or otherwise... you are nothing more.<br/>\n[u.2:3.4] And what value does your conclusion bring, flawed as it may be?<br/>\n[u.1:3.2] That a hurricane can only be weathered, not stopped. Not redirected. A force of nature is uncaring and without intent, but a man...<br/>\n[u.2:3.5] Yes?<br/>\n[u.1:3.3] A man is none of those things.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.1:3.4] A man can be killed.<br/>\n[silence]<br/>\n[u.2:3.6] And there it is...<br/>\n[u.1:3.5] There what is...?<br/>\n[u.2:3.7] A sliver of hope.",

Willbreaker demands a subjugation more diffuse than the simple snick and smash of a physical brink. It does not have to touch you to wound you.<br/><br/>\nAnd lastly—and this is critical: To be taken in Willbreaker&#39;s grasp is to know true bliss; that is, to be simplified; that is, to be reduced to one&#39;s most basic level, shedding all higher-order thoughts of fear or duty or selfishness; that is, to feel only pain.<br/><br/>\nNow do you see?

With the right inputs and an energy source, Glimmer can be transmuted into nearly anything. This makes it precious to the City&#39;s industries and artisans. That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond the City&#39;s walls.<br/><br/>\nGlimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City&#39;s industry, which converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.<br/><br/>\nBetween this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians. <br/><br/>\nNewborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City&#39;s economy turning. If good times lead to a resource boom, that surplus may help mass-produce advanced gear.",

Why would you be out here if you weren&#39;t here to...It&#39;s a miracle I found you out here. On this thing. <br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t know the Traveler sent its Ghosts out this far from home. <br/><br/>\nPoor little lost thing. Please wake up.<br/><br/>\nI am an Arach of Dead Orbit. I am the last of the crew of the Sophia. And this place is...it doesn&#39;t have a name. We called it A-113.<br/><br/>\nHow long have you been here, little Ghost? Why did you come?<br/><br/>\nListen. We came here on behalf of the Fleet. We were scavengers. Sixty-one days ago a Dead Orbit scout detected an unknown presence in stationary orbit about Ceres. 133 west. Looked Golden Age, by the signatures. Human. A small station. No prior records. We - <br/><br/>\nI suppose we should have disclosed it to the Tower, but we didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t. That was my call. We wanted it for ourselves, whatever it was. For the Fleet. If we&#39;d told the Tower, maybe they might have sent a Guardian not of our making instead...Doesn&#39;t matter now, does it, little one? <br/><br/>\nIf I ramble it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t slept in seven days.<br/><br/>\nSeven point five days ago; that was when the Sophia dropped into the Belt. They saw us at once. We dropped and the alarms went off and that was the end, that was the end right then, but they let us go on for another seven-point-five days, didn&#39;t they? The alarms. Hostile scan detected. An Awoken ship had us in its sights, just a couple hundred kilometers away. Like it had been waiting for us. It could have wiped us out of space right then but instead it crippled our engines and our comms and then for days it played with us, like a cat, we limped half-way round the Belt and it was always there...<br/><br/>\nWe abandoned the Sophia one-point-five days ago. We jumped ship for A-113. <br/><br/>\nI don&#39;t know what else to call it. I don&#39;t know what it was built for. There are these things, like keyholes. The rangefinders say they go on for thousands of kilometers. The others went inside and found - well, some of them are still screaming about the eye. All the other voices that come back are more terrible.<br/><br/>\nThere&#39;s salvage here but it&#39;ll never come home, none of it. None of it except maybe you, little Ghost.<br/><br/>\nWake up. <br/><br/>\nWake up. Go home. Tell them to strike A-113 from the records. Tell them to forget the Sophia, and the mission, and her crew.<br/><br/>\nEND RECORD",

I am here for one battle, and one alone, because it is a battle we must all fight, together or separately. So I will warn the defenders, together or separately. I will do anything—&quot; her low voice shook with passion— &quot;to end Oryx.&quot;<br/><br/>\nA silence rang out in the room. The Hunter kept her head raised, her ambiguous gaze directed at the shadows in the throne where the Queen reclined.<br/><br/>\nThen a small smile curved the Queen&#39;s lips. &quot;Well said.&quot; She straightened, and leaned slightly forward so the room&#39;s light fell on her face.<br/><br/>\n&quot;So let us end him.&quot;",

Follow anyone who passes through.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;In the name of your sister,&quot; the machine vowed. And it went to find its warp capsule, just as another came in.

The prince stroked them flat with slow assured motions. &quot;Tell me your news,&quot; he said again. &quot;What&#39;s the harm?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;The Heart is growing stronger,&quot; the crow said. &quot;The Vex transformation has begun, and the Progeny are stirring.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThe prince considered this in silence for a moment and then he wrapped the crow up in his fist and folded its wings around it so that it could not move or fly. He did all this swiftly, and with purpose.<br/><br/>\nCarrying the machine, he went to see his sister.<br/><br/>\nShe was alone with her Fallen guards, sitting before a window into infinity. Her eyes did not leave the universe; but sensing her brother she said &quot;Yes. What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s news to share,&quot; he said, and offered the crow in his fist. &quot;And I think I have earned the right to share it.&quot;",

Once, I was proud to call myself a Corsair in your service. My sisters and I were the sharp edge of your will, cutting across the stars in protection of the Reef.<br/><br/>\nIt was your service that kept me from sorrow after Amethyst was razed. The loss of my sisters, my whole life, as our station burned... it took something from me.<br/><br/>\nBy your will, it was given back to me.<br/><br/>\nPromoting me to the Corsairs, allowing me to strike back at the Wolves. Letting my fury find purchase in defense, in support, and in glorious battle. I know, as I’m sure you did, that without focus my heart would have grown toxic.<br/><br/>\nIt was my pride in my position that sustained me through the Hildean Campaign. That led me to victory in battle against Veliniks, the &quot;Forgotten Kell&quot;, the last hope for the unchained Wolves. I know now that it was my willful pride that brought me low.<br/><br/>\nMy lady, I offer again the only explanation I can: I did not know the Guardians would act as they did. All I had known, all I had ever known, were the ways of the Awoken.<br/><br/>\nThe Wolves were entrenched in that valley. The approaches were blocked, all sight lines covered. An assault on their position was madness. We would have spent precious Awoken lives. For nothing. I saw the Guardians, knew they were on the move, but I assumed they saw the situation as we did. That it was folly to call in the Crows.<br/><br/>\nPrince Uldren’s fighter wing did a masterful job. The blast was pinpoint precise. The blasts tore apart the Wolves, and the Guardians, and their Ghosts. Three strike teams of Guardians, gone in an instant, on my order. The City’s anger, the Speaker’s condemnation—all earned. All fair.<br/><br/>\nBut it has been years since the Reef Wars. The City, these— people. They are not like us. They do not understand their place in the world. And do not listen when I speak it.<br/><br/>\nPlease, allow me to return home to my people.<br/><br/>\nTo serve you once again.",

								"cardDescription" : "The sound of her voice ripped him from sleep.  He jumped up; his ship was still contained in its protective sphere.  He tried to retract the shield, but it was locked to its initiation time.  He couldn’t remember activating it.  Then he remembered the battle.  That blast.<br/><br/>\nWhat that ship fired was ancient, not bound to anything the Origin Libraries even sought to describe.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to calm down.  He thought of her, searching for her pull.  He couldn’t find it, but he was not calm.  She always told him she would always be there behind the calm.<br/><br/>\nAll he could hear were echoes of that sound.<br/><br/>\nIt began as soon as they hit the ring plane, ringing in the old glimmer of his long-buried self.  Before she showed him who he was—in the before and the after.<br/><br/>\nThe Techeuns should’ve known what the Dreadnaught could do.  Must’ve known.  Did they not feel what he felt?  Hear what he heard?  And that damn Ketch, it wasn’t protected.  They had to know that.  All to deploy the Harbingers.  They barely got a foothold before the weapon was fired.  He thought of Petra and how overwhelmed she must be, forced to hold her post, and watch her people perish.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to calm himself again, forcing long breaths.  He realized where he was: Mars. Athabasca. The Candor Isles.  He hadn’t been here in so long, not since he found the Black Garden.<br/><br/>\nThe countdown to the shield’s deactivation pulsed.  He tried again, to home in on her, to find if she truly gave herself for this battle.  He felt close to something, a hum of starlight, then shield deactivation broke his focus.<br/><br/>\nHe climbed out and saw the damage to his ship, and the truths of the armada&#39;s devastation sunk in.<br/><br/>\nHe turned in despair to find hundreds of his Crow drones, deployed on Mars long ago, circling his ship, waiting.<br/><br/>\n“Welcome back, Master.” The one closest to him spoke first, and the others followed, a wave of salutations echoed throughout the dry sea.<br/><br/>\nAnd with that hope returned.<br/><br/>\n“Begin repairs on the ship immediately. Something has gone missing and you will help me find it.”",

But centuries of explorers’ tales spoke of a surviving, elusive Warmind –a myth substantiated when Guardians exploring the old Cosmodrome made positive contact with Rasputin. A single Warmind still lives, diminished but unbroken.<br/><br/>\nThreatened by a convergence of Fallen and Hive forces, Rasputin exploited the reactivation of the Cosmodrome’s Terrestrial-space array to extend itself across the inner solar system. The Guardian Vanguard hoped that Rasputin might make a powerful ally, capable of mapping and reviving Golden Age military assets and recruiting them for the City’s defense. But Rasputin has proven recalcitrant and high-handed, unresponsive to the City’s outreach.<br/><br/>\nWe cannot characterize Rasputin’s strategic objectives and capabilities, cannot define its physical or computational architecture, cannot ascertain its disposition with regard to the City, and cannot be sure it retains memory of events before the Collapse. Perhaps what remains is only an autonomic shell, defending itself by reflex. Or perhaps Rasputin’s objectives have changed, transformed by some vital information it obtained during those dark days.<br/><br/>\nRasputin’s survival opens the possibility that other Warminds may be revivable, opening weapons systems to aid in City defenses. The Vanguard and the Consensus hope that continued outreach towards Rasputin will develop into a strategic alliance.",

								"cardDescription" : "People say I&#39;m a real confident guy. That&#39;s true enough. Out in the field I never had a second thought.<br/><br/>\nMy old friend Andal—he used to stand here, right in this spot—he&#39;d come up with these wild stories. He&#39;d say, you know, Cayde, I&#39;ve been examining the evidence, and personally I&#39;ve come to think it&#39;s you. You&#39;re Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you&#39;d remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.<br/><br/>\nYou can see how that&#39;d be embarrassing, especially when he&#39;d say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I&#39;d just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I&#39;m honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I&#39;d best leave it to you.<br/><br/>\nThen Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.<br/><br/>\nOne day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed warsats, when we send Holborn to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome—what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?<br/><br/>\nWould we all be saved?<br/><br/>\nGood question, she says—hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.<br/><br/>\nRight, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.<br/><br/>\nBut the Traveler&#39;s silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.<br/><br/>\nSo I say what I want to say every day, it&#39;s no secret, I say—well, I&#39;ll go find it, then. I&#39;ll go tell Rasputin we need its help.<br/><br/>\nAnd Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that—you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn&#39;t just that we can&#39;t find Rasputin. The problem is that it&#39;s not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.<br/><br/>\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost—what did it learn? What&#39;s it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin&#39;s mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?<br/><br/>\n&#39;I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a lesser master. But I learned to be something more...&#39;",

She leaps from the Sparrow and gets cover between slabs of ancient stone haunted by quiet firefly light.<br/><br/>\nHarvesters sweep overhead, cautious, prowling. On the Cabal command network a low voice mutters in their tongue, saying: Stand by to fire. They are coming. Stand by to fire.<br/><br/>\nHearing this she climbs a stone obelisk and perches on its point to watch the night sky. She wonders whether she will ever stand in the Tower courtyard and look up at the stars waiting for ruin.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex erupt from nothingness and crash down over the Cabal in formations of golden light. Lightning arcs and snaps and gives birth to marching ranks of bronze warrior hulls. Gun positions thunder back. Tracers sweep the sky and she can feel on her skin the electromagnetic howl of Cabal munitions seeking targets and the prickle of stranger signals that whisper of broken space and bent time. A Harvester spins down burning to shatter itself on the sand and now the command network drums with grim Cabal war-speak, a Centurion somewhere crying Black Shield, Black Shield, Firebase Thuria, perimeter compromised, request terminal protective fire, zero six zero, one three eight, immediate effect—<br/><br/>\nSomething else is watching too.<br/><br/>\nDo you feel that? her Ghost whispers, awestruck.<br/><br/>\nYes, she says, yes, what is it?<br/><br/>\nA third song, a stealthy regard, something high above them not Vex nor Cabal narrowing its great eye to measure the battle with instruments of light and gravity. Does she—remember it? Does it remember her? It feels like she should...<br/><br/>\nShe has the sense of something old lifting a long spear. Testing its heft.<br/><br/>\nThen dawn light, a terrible dawn—the sky opens up to admit devastation, thrown down from orbit: Minotaurs fall burnt and broken with their fluids boiling out. Cabal guns detonate in thunderous chains as tiny piercing flechettes fall out of the sky and find their ammunition bunkers.<br/><br/>\nThe battle stops. The Vex wink out. On the Cabal network the voice of Valus Ta&#39;aurc roars: Find the source! Rouse the Flayers and find the source!<br/><br/>\nShe remembers word from Earth: the Array opened. A ghost of the Cosmodrome set loose. And she wonders who won this battle, who learned the most, the Vex baiting out this new power, or the Cabal hunting it. Or the Warmind itself, testing its reborn strength.<br/><br/>\nWhen someone kills Ta&#39;aurc and the Flayers, as they killed Draksis, whose purpose will they serve?<br/><br/>\nBut this is not for her.

								"cardDescription" : "What drives a Warlock to madness?<br/><br/>\nGhosts choose those suited to war and heroism to be reborn. By nature or circumstance they go to battle against the Darkness, and through this battle they learn how to use the Light. But Warlocks, by their nature, fight a second, internal war. This is the war to understand a universe of secrets— a world that expects Guardians to fight without full knowledge of what they are or what they might hope to achieve.<br/><br/>\nYou were a mighty warrior. I watched you at Six Fronts, and heeded the call of Saint-14 to appoint you Vanguard Commander, even when the Concordat claimed to have records proving you were a Golden Age experiment mis-incarnated as a human by an inept Ghost. Saint-14 assured me you were just a man without much patience for obfuscation.<br/><br/>\nI watched as you grew tired of strike missions and the grueling, unproductive sessions with the Cryptarchs. That was when I took you under my wing. I saw our future in you. But your curiosity was voracious— How much of a Guardian&#39;s personality and memories were true? How much had been fabricated by their Ghost? Did Guardians share particular personality traits— a willingness to yield to authority, a tendency to do anything anyone asked for the promise of uncertain reward, a blind knight-errant mentality? Had the Traveler manufactured all of you as living weapons?<br/><br/>\nI admit, I found your questions divisive and disloyal, and I feared you might be capable of breaking our unity when the City&#39;s position had grown so tenuous. Why divert attention away from the Traveler, our only hope?<br/><br/>\nAnd then it got worse, dabbling in thanatonautics, Ahamkara-lore, chasing after Xur and the tricks of the Nine. Launching expeditions into the Reef and beyond at a time when ships were irreplaceable. Your quest split Guardians along ideological lines. This was your greatest crime: Hunters chose to pursue your visions instead of protecting refugees, Titans assembled teams to chase the legendary Vault of Glass instead of striking the Fallen, and Warlocks turned away from the study of the Traveler in favor of  your  ultimate obsession... learning the exact nature of the Darkness.<br/><br/>\nWhen debate became argument, and argument became acrimony, I realized you had already become a cult of personality, attracting Guardians who wanted a clear idea of why they were fighting, what they faced, and how they would ultimately win.<br/><br/>\nI don’t know where you have gone, but I can no longer send Ghosts out to find you. Some come back— with tales of your death or how you went seeking answers from the far reaches of space and time. That you found a way to explore the Vex gate networks. That you&#39;ve made breakthrough after breakthrough as to their origins— theories that a Guardian could not be simulated, that the Traveler might be an ontoformer or a god-incubator, that the Vex had diverged into multiple groups in order to secure &#39;an end state for every possible configuration of reality&#39;.<br/><br/>\nI fear you have become as obsessed with the Vex as Toland was with the Hive. I&#39;ve heard your own insane prophecies about pits and dead Hive kings. And of Crota, which now I cannot deny. <br/><br/>\nI hear stories of Lord Shaxx meeting with fireteams of Warlocks who have no shadow and never blink. Of jumpships slipping into the Reef on cold trajectories and meeting no intercept. Of questions hidden in matter engrams and answers decrypted on distant battlefields. <br/><br/>\nPerhaps you are still out there. If this reaches you, I would very much like to speak with you, to hear your theories in your own words.<br/><br/>\nPerhaps what drives a Warlock to madness is truth.",

This is not the beginning but it is the reason.<br/><br/>\nThe Garden grows in both directions. It grows into tomorrow and yesterday. The red flowers bloom forever.<br/><br/>\nThere are gardeners now. They came into the garden in vessels of bronze and they move through the groves in rivers of thought.<br/><br/>\nThis is the vision I had when I leapt from the Shores of Time and let myself sink:<br/><br/>\nI walked beneath the blossoms. The light came from ahead and the shadows of the flowers were words. They said things but I will not write them here.<br/><br/>\nAt the end of the path grew a flower in the shape of a Ghost. I reached out to pluck it and it cut me with a thorn. I bled and the blood was Light. <br/><br/>\nThe Ghost said to me: You are a dead thing made by a dead power in the shape of the dead. All you will ever do is kill. You do not belong here. This is a place of life.<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler is life, I said. You are a creature of Darkness. You seek to deceive me.<br/><br/>\nBut I looked behind me, down the long slope where the blossoms tumbled in the warm wind and the great trees wept sap like blood or wine, and I felt doubt.<br/><br/>\nWhen my Ghost raised me from the sea there was a thorn-cut in my left hand and it has not healed since.",

The people we work with and the people we see in the street and the people we tell about our dreams. We kill them all. I think because we were made to kill and this is the part of us that thinks about nothing else.<br/><br/>\nOften I kill people I don&#39;t know, but like most of us I think I knew them once, in the time before one reset or another, when my mind was younger and less terribly scarred.<br/><br/>\nSo that is how we go back to the Deep Stone Crypt, where we were born.",

Waves slam through the gap and where they hit the stone they throw up pillars of spray that pierce the mist and crash down in thunder. There&#39;s a giant in the cataract, trying to wade against the current, and I can tell it wants to reach the lever and pull the lever which will seal off the flow or maybe give it the sword, but the torrent throws it back so it just keeps its head down and tries to push on. I can&#39;t see the face but it breathes out white smoke. I feel for it hard.<br/><br/>\nA world painted around the interior like a stranger Earth everted and glued inside itself but I don&#39;t believe this one it&#39;s too much like a metaphor.<br/><br/>\nA switchboard or a train station, empty, dead (waiting). The tunnels branch off into infinity. I stare down one for a long time and see a pale worm move in hungry coils around itself. I think this one is the most likely although I might have brought the worm.<br/><br/>\nAn egg but I&#39;m not sure if the broth inside is warm still, or if it&#39;s gone to rot, or if the warmth comes from the struggles of the tiny winged zygote or the bleed from the wound or the thoughts of something thinking very hard.<br/><br/>\nA star I think. We count on stars as steady friends because they always rise and always shine but a star&#39;s a delicate truce: an explosion caught by its own mass so that it can&#39;t erupt and can&#39;t collapse. Thus I imagine the state of the machine might be. But one force or another has gone awry and now it rests here, snuffed and broken, waiting for the two rival forms of ruin to be set in balance again.",

								"cardDescription" : "The cell cracks open. Skolas, Wolf Kell, stumbles out and crashes to his knees.<br/><br/>\nHe tries to leap at the creature before him, the shape in the fog, to show it why it should be afraid. But the weight of grief smashes his legs against the cell. The rage upon him beats him to the floor. He falls on all four hands, his mighty armor thundering against itself.<br/><br/>\nHis House of Wolves is enslaved! His people have been played! And it was his hubris, his would-be cunning that did it! While the other Houses fought for their future on Earth, throwing themselves at the Great Machine, Skolas wasted his people in games of betrayal and ambition. Bitter pride brought a bitter end!<br/><br/>\nIf Skolas were a Kell he would ask his Archon to dock him. Ether hisses in his mask and it tastes cold, so cold.<br/><br/>\nHe looks up. At the tiny hooded shape before him. The cell&#39;s mist is clearing. He can see.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I believe that I am here,&quot; the creature says. To Skolas&#39; ears it has a strange voice, a strange accent. It speaks his language. &quot;I have a clear purpose. I cannot explain it. Forgive me.&quot;<br/><br/>\nFrom beneath its hood, tiny fingers of shadow probe the air.<br/><br/>\nSkolas rises up to smash it, to show his strength, because the alternative to violence is waiting for violence to come from a universe that has neither respect nor compassion. But he checks himself. His ambitions have brought him here, to this cell in this strange place... only it&#39;s not so strange, is it? It&#39;s the hold of a Ketch. &quot;The Queen,&quot; he says to the thing. &quot;You work for the Queen.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;The Nine made me aware of my purpose,&quot; the creature says. &quot;If am here, then it is because the Queen sent you to the Nine, and they wish you sent back.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I will do no one else&#39;s work.&quot; Skolas has been a pawn long enough. A Dreg told him, once, that she would play in a game as long as the game made sense. Nothing makes sense now except the thought of Variks&#39; throat shattering in his fists. Variks! Variks the utterly disloyal, Variks who should be welded into a Ketch&#39;s prow atom by atom and left there as a figurehead to burn away.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I am comfortable,&quot; the creature with the moving face says. &quot;A part of me wants to go somewhere warm. Now I will certainly tell you what you have been given.&quot;<br/><br/>\nSkolas looks at the shrapnel gun in his hands. Skolas imagines what he would do with it if he could reach Variks, or the brother of the Queen, or the alien Queen. Will it save anything they&#39;ve lost? The worlds docked from them? No. It cannot change the past. Only the future. Only the chance that his people might one day know themselves as more than pirates and scavengers.<br/><br/>\nHe should never have tried to be Kell of Wolves. He should have tried to be Kell of everything. Everything wants to kill his people, the machines and the militants and the green-eyed Hive. The dead soldiers that hoard the Great Machine and come out crusading to wipe all hope away.<br/><br/>\n&quot;The ship will be yours,&quot; the creature says. It hunches over itself as if burdened by its own shape. &quot;If you speak, you will be heard. I will go now. You are free.&quot;<br/><br/>\nHe tries to follow it. He fails. Somehow it is gone. He goes up to the throne room, and sets his weapon down on the great seat. Skolas, Kell of Kells, goes to the ship&#39;s comm and looks for the sign of a Servitor, for the way to plot a course.",

Carefully tended lakes and rivers, water everywhere, wind their way between fields of lush iridescent crops and into groves of starkly colored trees.  Every inch of the land seems engineered, brushed by a sculptor&#39;s hand for form and function both.<br/><br/>\nThe sky is a light pink, spotted with clouds and crowded with ships.  Thick lanes of aerial traffic soar through the air, tightly managed and seemingly endless.<br/><br/>\nAnd beyond it all, above the clouds, hangs a perfect alabaster sphere.

The New Monarchy and Future War Cult as well, though fewer examples can be seen.  Others bears symbols never seen in the Tower to date.<br/><br/>\nEvery single ship, from the largest cruiser to the smallest personal craft, carries shards of stone, remnants of the City and the Tower.  Banners too, tattered and worn from entering and leaving warp.<br/><br/>\nThe fleet is only visible for a few breaths, less than a minute.  Then, with a massive flash of light, the fleet jumps on.

And another few years to get it transmitting.  Now, in the brief windows of time when the door to his cell opened, he would call for help.  He sighed, a deliberate act that caused him to cough roughly. He had no idea how much longer his body would hold out.  But then, that kind of thinking was all relative here, wasn&#39;t it?<br/><br/>\nPraedyth stared at the sprawling mass of metal and wires, listening to the tinny sounds coming from his makeshift speaker.  Before he spoke, he always made a point to listen.  The words, the concepts that flowed into his mind confused him.  Timelines and potentialities that might have already happened, might happen, might never happen.<br/><br/>\nA pattern was ever dancing in the edge of his vision.  At times like this, when the world rushed past him, he had to hold tight to the fact that he was still breathing.  He would often focus in on the intake, output, inbreath, outbreath, breath, breath, breath... hours later, he blinked.  Refocused.  The static had stopped. He had missed a window.<br/><br/>\nOnce, he would have cursed and spat.  Now, he just shook his head.  A weak movement of the neck.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex had decided their end.  The Guardians had interceded.  The Vex were fallible.<br/><br/>\nIf the Vex can be wrong... if they can make mistakes... someday he could be free.  Someday he might leave the Vault, might see again the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nUntil then he would listen, he would observe.  He would be the man on the outside looking in, a viewpoint into the consciousness of Minds that spanned galaxies.  He would try to understand the Vex.<br/><br/>\nPraedyth closed his eyes.",

								"cardDescription" : "Rezyl Azzir was a man.<br/><br/>\nIn time his kind would be called Titan. Mountains of muscle and might and metal. His collar was fur and teeth. His person clad in ornate, golden-etched plating, trophies upon his shoulders.<br/><br/>\nThis was before the City was The City.<br/><br/>\nThis is before the walls. Still in the shadow of the fragile giant above, but before.<br/><br/>\nSalvation seekers came — survivors; weary remnants of a people on the brink.<br/><br/>\nThese were the days before reason took hold. Before study was merged with belief.<br/><br/>\nThe giant was looked to as one would a God.  Maybe it still is.<br/><br/>\nFactions grew from the huddled masses. Like minds coming together to provide support, comfort. Over time these loyalties demanded loyalty. Differences that used to inform — viewpoints that when joined granted a larger understanding of the whole — became points of conflict. The sanctuary became divided. The shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanity’s last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.<br/><br/>\nGreat, powerful men and women, The Risen, stood at the Factions’ sides. Protection. Enforcers. Misused possibility.<br/><br/>\nMisery crept into this false paradise. Yet hope lingered.<br/><br/>\nSeeing the cracks in this society born beneath the giant’s fractured shell, some among The Risen challenged the dissolution of all that could be. They would no longer serve as instruments of oppression. They would be more.<br/><br/>\nThus began an unnecessary war made necessary by greed, ambition... fear. And, in the chaos of this struggle, came the scavengers — aliens with appetites. A common enemy.<br/><br/>\nIn the end, the scavengers were repelled and the Factions fell, their grip broken, though their beliefs remained. This was the earliest days of the Guardians, when might found purpose. Prosperity was in reach.<br/><br/>\nRezyl had been a champion of these wars. A leader. Against the alien pirates he had been more. If the giant wasn’t a God, then maybe Rezyl was.<br/><br/>\nAs the first walls formed — built of hard work and sacrifice — Rezyl and the Guardians stood against the alien plunderers time and again. More survivors arrived. More warriors.<br/><br/>\nThe Guardian ranks swelled.<br/><br/>\nThe City grew.<br/><br/>\nHope blossomed. To Rezyl it was a currency. Hope bought tomorrow. Tomorrow bought the effort needed to survive today.<br/><br/>\nYet Rezyl grew weary. Stories haunted his nights. Old stories. Those no longer told. Those locked behind tight lips for fear of what they may invoke. Whenever the sun dropped below the horizon and the moon rose high, Rezyl’s thoughts wandered. How safe was safe? How long could they fight with the Darkness still writhing?<br/><br/>\nSo, every day Rezyl would fight and build and protect. And every day a city grew beneath the giant. And every night he would think about all that was never said and stare intently at the moon above.",

We didn&#39;t, you know, do anything actively - no handshake, no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I don&#39;t even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.<br/><br/>\nOf course I ran. <br/><br/>\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.<br/><br/>\nI didn&#39;t really have time to shoot her and she didn&#39;t really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.<br/><br/>\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I&#39;ll pass it over.<br/><br/>\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don&#39;t know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn&#39;t howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.<br/><br/>\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn&#39;t died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.<br/><br/>\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she&#39;d ended on those broken blades.<br/><br/>\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn&#39;t seem surprised.<br/><br/>\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.<br/><br/>\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.",

Remember the City of the Death of Children, the City That Docks, which claimed for itself the Great Machine that might have saved us. Remember the City that even now sends its ghouls to murder our Primes, starve our ether, and leave our young to die gasping. Curse that City and its name. The curse is just.<br/><br/>\nWe gathered to take that City and save ourselves from extinction, saying to each other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a darkness, for it is said that only pain may be stolen from the dark, and we can let no more be stolen from us. We gathered to fight against our twilight, King and Devil and Winter, all of us but us, the Wolves. Why? What kept us from the Gap?<br/><br/>\nThe Reef. The Queen.

These sly sterile un-people, these mirages with cold minds twinned to their own, these Carybdis butchers, they set us against each other. She played us. She made herself our Kell.<br/><br/>\nWe were fools, o children of the Whirlwind. We fought each other when we most needed unity. I fought my rivals when I should have fought the Queen.

I am the Dreg of Dregs because I remember that a dreg will grow back what is lost to him.<br/><br/>\nAsk them my name! Ask them with the shock blade and the shrapnel launcher! Ask them with the skiff and the ketch! Ask your masters by what right they master you, you who have been hardened by centuries of flight, you who inherit the Whirlwind! Ask the Queen for her throne!<br/><br/>\nAsk them our name. Let them answer: you are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen no more.",

Ceres is the white queen of this space, four hundred million kilometers from the Sun. Ceres is round. Round means power, out here: nothing else in the Belt is big enough to crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity. Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a crown.<br/><br/>\nThere are other lights, newer stars, newer crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is full of warrens and shipyards and habitats, because Ceres is round and lucky as a Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the Wolves she wants to rule.<br/><br/>\nShark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and tribes. Skiffs. Ketches. The Kell of Wolves has a fleet gathered here. The Kell of Wolves heard the call, and summoned the House of Wolves to prepare for the great battle on Earth. The salvation of the Kell&#39;s people depends on their ability to shatter the City. It&#39;s a matter of survival.<br/><br/>\nNow the Wolf fleet turns to meet the Queen.<br/><br/>\nSee the squadrons of Skiffs wrapping themselves in stealth, cold and transparent, knifing out invisible and brave? See the Ketches like broad blades, the bright thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle? See them turning, accelerating, waking up their jammers and their arc guns? All doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of Wolves put all that strength in one place, and now the Queen of the Reef is coming to break it.<br/><br/>\nOut there, coming out of the dark, are the Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little fighters scattered around like four-pointed thorns. Destroyers and frigates and salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And right at the front, at the speartip, flies the Queen.<br/><br/>\nThe Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies strength of metal and equipment. The Kell considers the chance that the Awoken have some secret weapon, something gleaned from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by the witches, and sets that chance aside. The Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and warning. I AM LORD OF WOLVES, the Kell sends. YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE. THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.<br/><br/>\nThe Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts. Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs hidden under jamming and camouflage, find their firing solutions.<br/><br/>\nThe Queen&#39;s ship broadcasts. I AM NOBLE TOO, she says, OH LORD OF WOLVES.<br/><br/>\nThe Kell doesn&#39;t mind a little banter before the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies. YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO POWER. Captains and Barons signal their readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis, Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear and loyalty, all ready for war.<br/><br/>\nSTARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER. The Queen&#39;s ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts. Servitors begin to report a strange taste in the void. AND MY FATHER WAS THE DARK.<br/><br/>\nHere, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel fear. CALL ON THEM, THEN, the Kell sends, one last mocking signal before death and ruin, AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER.<br/><br/>\nSo the Queen calls, as only she can. Every Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every Captain and Baron roars at their underlings as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter, as reactors stutter and power systems hum with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps. The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of war-code, maneuvers wild, fires blind.<br/><br/>\nBehind the Queen&#39;s ship, the Harbingers awaken.",

Mine dispensers provide close defense against dismounted infantry, and an on-board Shank foundry produces armed repair drones.<br/><br/>\nWalkers are immediate and deadly threats, having ended the Light of countless Guardians. The Fallen do not hesitate to deploy them to provide overwatch for their salvage and extraction crews. Walkers are also commonly used as blocking forces to guard key Fallen assets. At the Battle of Twilight Gap, Walkers engaged in a thunderous artillery duel with the City&#39;s gun positions.<br/><br/>\nThe collected wisdom of battle-hardened Guardians suggests Walkers can be beaten by focusing fire on the legs, overloading the Walker and rendering its armored core briefly vulnerable. When the Walker stumbles, Guardians should focus all available firepower on the exposed components beneath the neck plating. Some externally mounted weapons can also be disabled with precise fire.",

Variks should be happy. He&#39;s not. With his little knife and his two arms and his stolen shining thing he feels like a Dreg. He feels ashamed.<br/><br/>\nHe betrayed Skolas twice. At Cybele, and again, now. He will betray Skolas&#39; dream ten times more. Variks will never be strong like Skolas, big like Skolas, a leader like Skolas. Variks will work for the Queen, oversee the Prisons, watch his fellow Fallen (they are Fallen, it&#39;s a good name now) fight and die as gladiators who want nothing except a chance to hurt Guardians. Even Skolas.<br/><br/>\nHe tried to use the Vex, word has it. He tried to use their machines. Has that ever worked for anyone? Maybe one. Maybe a few: the Osiris cultists are Variks&#39; favorite people. Maybe that&#39;s how you survive this alien star where dead gods slumber and dead heroes walk. You cozy up to powers you barely understand and make yourself useful, or at least inoffensive. You become a parasite, a scavenger, a servant.<br/><br/>\nThat&#39;s dreg strength.

								"cardDescription" : "Skolas is dead. <br/><br/>\nVariks sits carving at his piece of amethyst. His undocked arms are weaker, less precise, but it is a comfort to feel the crystal press hard into his palm. The knife slips. He cuts himself. &quot;Ai,&quot; he says, and of course right then the door opens, Variks has no privacy, Variks wants no privacy, Variks lives to serve the Queen.<br/><br/>\nIt&#39;s Petra Venj. She&#39;s masked against the ether air. &quot;The Prince wants to speak,&quot; she says, and then, seeing him unmasked and bleeding, she chuckles. Petra depends on Variks for intelligence and Variks, frustrated with her insane risk-taking and bravado, sometimes gives her tips meant to get her killed. Petra has figured this out. Petra and Variks know each other&#39;s agendas and each other&#39;s strengths and to Variks that&#39;s as close as any two people can get. Petra is smart: she sends Guardians now, people who can die as much as they like.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You slipped,&quot; she says.<br/><br/>\nVariks holds up the amethyst in his bleeding hand. It&#39;s a Reef gem. &quot;I wound myself,&quot; he says, &quot;to make this more beautiful.&quot;<br/><br/>\nShe stares into the gem with a distant Awoken eye. What does she see? Variks knows she has visions and he knows those visions haunt her, drive her. The Awoken are twinned to powers that terrify Variks. He&#39;d dock himself again before he&#39;d let the Queen&#39;s witches near him, the witches who raised Petra.<br/><br/>\nThe unfairness of it makes him want to roar. Why does everyone else have this patronage? Why do the Hive have gods and the Vex have sprawling time-bent minds and the Cabal have reinforcements? Why do the Awoken whisper to the stars and listen for the whisper back, the voices from the Jovians, the song in the dark? Why do the Guardians get the Great Machine&#39;s blessing, was it like that before the Whirlwind, were there Fallen heroes crowned in Ghosts who strode the battlefield fearless and full of Light? Why do they tell stories about reclaiming the lost glory of humanity, and no stories about the lost glory of Variks&#39; people, the House of Judgment that once kept codes of dignity and law?<br/><br/>\nWhy can&#39;t the Fallen have that strength? But no, that strength is not for them, not for Variks. Just this bleeding, sad pragmatism. Just dreg strength. Hanging on.<br/><br/>\nThe alternative is Skolas&#39; strength, fighting together, raging against extinction. Look where that&#39;s gotten the species. The House of Devils&#39; Prime is dead. The House of Winter&#39;s leadership devastated. The poor Exiles trying to claw out some security against the Hive. In the last few years the Fallen have lost so much—and everything is escalating around them. There are gods and powers converging on this system, old machines waking up, old bones whispering flatteries. They need a new way.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Put your mask on,&quot; Petra says. &quot;The Prince gets sullen if he&#39;s kept waiting.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Not like us,&quot; Variks says, oh so mild. The wound on his hand will heal. His work in the Prison of Elders, setting up trial by combat, building an audience and a relationship with the Reef&#39;s scavengers and armories, will bring him a little closer towards rebuilding the House of Judgment. Skolas&#39; fury has guttered out. The Fallen may yet accept peaceful, lawful rule. They may yet survive. They&#39;ll hang on. &quot;We&#39;re very patient, yes?&quot;<br/><br/>\nPetra looks down on him with pity and contempt and a strange fondness.<br/><br/>\nHe puts on his mask.",

That was a thing that had never happened before.<br/><br/>\nThen the Techeuns looked Earthward—and saw the Fallen there becoming bolder. Tactics suggested they were planning a massive attack. We had no interplanetary arrays—no way to warn Earth. We thought we would be able to do nothing but watch.<br/><br/>\nBut then the Wolves arrived from the Jovians. Their army was hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions strong: a dark wave that washed over the Reef, rushing toward the Earth. As soon as we saw them it was clear that if the Wolves reached Earth, the City would fall.<br/><br/>\nSeemingly oblivious to our existence, the bulk of the Wolf fleet stopped to regroup at Ceres. The Queen&#39;s decision was this: attack the House of Wolves, thereby saving Earth but revealing the Reef&#39;s presence to any and all enemies in the quadrant; or remain silent, preserving the Reef&#39;s invisibility but allowing the City to perish.<br/><br/>\nHer Harbingers ripped into Ceres, destroying the asteroid and killing Virixas, Kell of Wolves and more than half his House. The remaining Wolves scattered, burrowing deep into the Belt for cover. There, new claimants to the Kellship quickly arose: Irxis, Wolf Baroness; Parixas, the Howling; and Skolas, the Rabid.",

Working with the Techeuns and the Crows, they created an enormous visual illusion of the Harbingers, making it seem as if the Queen had finally decided to cut her losses and destroy the asteroid. It worked—the false Harbingers so scared the Wolf fleet that they broke ranks.

The Queen could not use her Harbingers against them—if she did, Imogen Rife and her fleet and all the people of Pallas would have been killed as well.<br/><br/>\nFor years the siege endured. At first, neither side dared to attack the other: on Pallas, Paladin Rife knew that Pirsis had the firepower to destroy the asteroid. Above Pallas, Pirsis held back, hoping to rescue Drevis and Kaliks-4 and the other Wolves that Paladin Rife had captured at the Battle of Bamberga&#39;s Wrath. The Queen sought to diffuse the siege by sending Armada Paladins Abra Zire and Kamala Rior into the Hildian Asteroids, where Skolas was rumored to be hiding, but with the help of his tactician Beltrik, the Veiled, Skolas thwarted them.<br/><br/>\nThe stalemate over Pallas was broken by, of all beings, a dreg. Ironically dubbed Weksis the Meek, the dreg led dozens of followers in an unsanctioned attack on Pallas. They managed to blast a hole in the Athens Hull, but were stopped soon after by Commander Hallam Fen. Weksis and the surviving followers were imprisoned alongside those they had come to save.",

Your sacrifice—<br/><br/>\nEris: I am still here. My sacrifice was—<br/><br/>\nIkora: Enough.<br/><br/>\nEris: And I should ask new heroes to fall... as they did?<br/><br/>\nIkora: It is why we were reborn in the Light.<br/><br/>\nEris: My Light is all but gone.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Cherish what remains, but know that you have done enough. Your time in the shadows... I can&#39;t fathom—<br/><br/>\nEris: My role among the Hidden is an honor.<br/><br/>\nIkora: None would argue. But it&#39;s had its cost. Your place is to gather the understanding we need to wage these wars, but your own war is long done. Let those prepared to fight, fight.<br/><br/>\nEris: And should they die?<br/><br/>\nIkora: None who walk these Towers is afraid—and Rasputin must not fall.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then Omnigul must be stopped.<br/><br/>\nIkora: Two goals that appear to be one and the same.<br/><br/>\nEris: Perhaps. So I am to stay?<br/><br/>\nIkora: I will see to it.<br/><br/>\nEris: Then let us hope we are strong enough to stand against what is upon us—and hope the others do not follow.",

								"cardDescription" : "If your Light is strong enough to hear across the soundless plains, you may have heard their screams.<br/><br/>\nWhat may seem like a void between their shrieks, holds, what I believe to be yet another clue to their origins. In one tone the Hive plea to their gods, but in the next, they whisper to another.<br/><br/>\nPerhaps it is here which holds the answer to their ultimate demise, or a bridge to their desires. In my studies, I still struggle to match the tones to their rune system. If only Crytparch Adonna were still with us. No one has yet to match her adept.<br/><br/>\nFour sounds, oft repeated, but only four. Though I am on the trail of a fifth, faintly heard from the buzz that once spilled from the Shrine—<br/><br/>\nEir.<br/><br/>\nUr.<br/><br/>\nXol.<br/><br/>\nYul.<br/><br/>\nIt is in these sounds that I fear yet another Hive secret hides. Perhaps beyond their gods, perhaps in accord with them. Perhaps these are just Hive translations of worlds we call another name, but I believe above all things they call to some kind of being. Beings that once lived, or still live somewhere buried amongst us. Beings the Hive perhaps owe their very existence to.<br/><br/>\nI am hoping the Warminds may hold further answers—that they can see into worlds where we can only see what lies upon them. The treasure of knowledge they promise still remains the most sought after of any Guardian. Whoever can find a way past their firewalls of ancient arts, and make them the allies they once were, could spare us further atrocities. And though Rasputin offers some promise, one can only hope its silence is self-defense, that it seeks only to preserve itself. We have to prove to it that we are on its side, but I am starting to doubt that is absolutely true. That maybe the Hive or the Darkness itself now have a grasp on his systems.<br/><br/>\nBut then again, I am an old man with many fears, and in those fears , often called madness, I will continue to dwell.",

We all died once, and it did not prove insurmountable.<br/><br/>\nBut what if what if what if, shhh listen, what if death were reified, described in its totality, made autonomous and universal, separate from any context or condition? What if She could invoke the ending of anything?<br/><br/>\nHow, then, would She know the song, and sing it, without Herself dying?<br/><br/>\nPerhaps they know a way to make themselves part of the song, part of something vast and burning that rots and peels into ash but never ever ends.

Any Guardian formidable enough to return with information on this dark reality might help us understand the Hive&#39;s goals for our own world—and, more pressingly, such an expedition might provide the key to Crota&#39;s defeat.<br/><br/>\nThe epithet Son of Oryx is an ambiguous translation, often disputed. At this time, no direct action by Hive entities of more expansive power has ever been observed. Those who trade in Hive lore bicker over the exact positioning of Crota—is his world the apex of Hive power, or is it the youngest and most accessible of a string of netherworlds, each host to a more terrible Hive archentity?<br/><br/>\nThe nature and possible interrelationship of the Vex gate system with Hive netherworlds remains unexplored.<br/><br/>\nIkora",

The Prohibition&#39;s tactics seem to be failing in the short run.<br/><br/>\nBut it seems unlikely that an organization with the sheer computational scope of the Vex could be dragged into a losing war of attrition. Is it possible that the Vex are trying to draw out the Cabal strength? Or that their surface losses are a distraction from a deeper strategic ploy?<br/><br/>\nIkora Rey has proposed that the Vex units can best be understood as algorithms - each a unique mapping of inputs to behavioral responses. Perhaps the Virgo Prohibition is simply the wrong algorithm for its environment, and its failure will drive the greater Vex network to adapt and improve.",

								"cardIntro" : "<b>Maya, Chioma, Duane-McNiadh and Shim decide to have a picnic before they send themselves into infinity.</b>",
								"cardDescription" : "Up here they have to act by biomechanical proxy. No human being in the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of the world to injure space and time. It&#39;s not safe. The cellular Vex elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational Vex elements are more dangerous yet— and there could be semiotic hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team&#39;s thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy, protected by distance and neural firewall.<br/><br/>\nBut they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Blue-green light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for dispersal.<br/><br/>\n&quot;I wonder where it came from,&quot; Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he&#39;s the one to break the reverent silence. &quot;The Citadel. I wonder if it was here before the Traveler changed Venus.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;It could have been latent,&quot; Chioma Esi suggests. She&#39;s the leader. She kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal torture. She pulled them through. &quot;Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a period of geological quiescence, so it could grow.&quot;<br/><br/>\nDr. Shim shrugs. &quot;I think the Traveler did something paracausal to Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn&#39;t have to make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon&#39;s new gravity.&quot;<br/><br/>\nMaya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She&#39;s been too quiet lately. What happened to them wasn&#39;t her fault and maybe she&#39;ll believe that soon. &quot;What could you do with it?&quot; she murmurs, staring up. &quot;If you understood it?&quot;<br/><br/>\nChioma puts an arm around her. &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to find out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;They&#39;re not us any more.&quot; Maya looks down at herself, at the cache of her self-forks. &quot;We&#39;re not going anywhere. We&#39;re sending them. They&#39;re diverging.&quot;<br/><br/>\nThey rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged. Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex information network as explorers.<br/><br/>\nWhen Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they&#39;re each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft, grieving? How many will be happy, like them?<br/><br/>\nChioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then, sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everything-is-okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn&#39;t notice.<br/><br/>\nThey climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex network, to see what&#39;s out there, and maybe come home.<br/><br/>\nIn the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen, setting up the equipment is like laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen they look like themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Do you think,&quot; Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, &quot;that you could use this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;I wish I could go back and change you into someone else,&quot; Dr. Shim grouses. Chioma&#39;s shaking her head. She knows physics. &quot;Time is self-consistent,&quot; she says. &quot;I think it&#39;s like the story of the merchant and the alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you needed.&quot; Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture, feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand. These proxy bodies are limited— they crash and need resetting every few hours, they struggle with latency, they can&#39;t hold much long term memory. But they&#39;ll get better. &quot;Or go forward and learn something vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and time.&quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;So it&#39;s just a way to make everything more complicated.&quot; Duane-McNiadh sighs. &quot;It doesn&#39;t fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should&#39;ve taken that job at— &quot;<br/><br/>\n&quot;You would&#39;ve hated it at Clovis,&quot; Dr. Shim says. &quot;We both know you&#39;re happier here.&quot; Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and then they both pretend to ignore each other.<br/><br/>\nThe four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each other about how long they&#39;ll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making ready to explore.",

								"cardDescription" : "RECORD 0-CHASM-0<br/><br/>\nMy love. I’ve opened this log as an apology.<br/><br/>\nAs a scientist, I believe in record-keeping. I believe in protocols, peer review, and ethical conduct. I believe in the importance of disbelief — you know: let’s run that one more time.<br/><br/>\nWhat I’m doing here in Lhasa isn’t science. It’s unethical, secret, and shameful. And after what happened in Ishtar, dearest Chioma, I know you’d be furious with me for getting involved. Forty years isn’t far enough to forget a day like that.<br/><br/>\nBut I believe it’s important. The least I can do is keep a few notes for you.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-01<br/><br/>\nTrial one. Subject one. <br/><br/>\nIt was an act of stupid loneliness. I used the device on myself because I...<br/><br/>\n[silence: 0:08]<br/><br/>\nI missed you. We hadn’t been apart for more than a year since we met. I’m not a very good wife, am I? You write me every week, even with all Hyperion’s work and all Hyperion’s distance keeping you from me. And I act like it’s not enough. <br/><br/>\nWe built the device in mimicry of the Vex gateway systems from Ishtar. An observatory, yes, but I think of it as a mind-ship. Capable of displacing its payload across space and time.<br/><br/>\nThe lab is cold and isolated. We are quarantined from the world, physically and mentally. We can’t send messages out. If we breach the Vex manifolds, even our words might transmit contagion. One night last month I missed you and so I —<br/><br/>\nI thought that I could look inside the device, and find one of the other Chiomas. I thought I could call out to one of the forks we sent out there to explore.<br/><br/>\nI just wanted to send my love.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-02<br/><br/>\nZakharik Gilmanovich Bekhterev. May he rest in peace. When our probes continued to fail, when my report remained our only positive finding, he volunteered to use the device. One minute of subjective experience inside.<br/><br/>\nWe took precautions. They worked. Bekhterev’s experience left no physical damage.<br/><br/>\nAfter we extracted him, he said that he felt determined. I asked him what he meant and he said that he meant it, he had been determined, he could feel all his choices set out before him like a railroad. Deviation was impossible.<br/><br/>\nHe died by suicide. I wonder if he was trying to make a point.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-03<br/><br/>\nWe’ve decided not to abort. It’s insane, isn’t it? There are pressures on us I can’t tell you about until I see you again.<br/><br/>\nThe purpose of the system is intelligence, you see. It’s stenciled right on the hull: SxISR.  Special asset. We would very much like to make it work reliably. <br/><br/>\nOur supervisory warmind has devised a drug it says will protect and prepare us.<br/><br/>\nI am beginning to wonder if we were wrong about the merchant and the alchemist. Or if that explanation of time was incomplete.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-09<br/><br/>\nKind Lakpha. He meditated before he went in. Nothing but d&#233;j&#224; vu and three seconds of screams. The screaming passed and he remembers nothing. The d&#233;j&#224; vu hasn’t. He says it’s getting better — he feels that we’ve had this conversation only ten times before, not a thousand. <br/><br/>\nI’ve suggested that we attempt mind forking. We need more sane people to work with. Please forgive me, my love.<br/><br/>\nWe are all growing superstitious. The behavior of the device is inconsistent. Impossible to replicate. We turn to ritual behavior to appease it.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-31<br/><br/>\nRajesh. When he reached a displacement of eight he told us he was dead. I believed him. He was dead. He spoke to us. It was true. Whatever he saw, it was his own future.<br/><br/>\nHe’s fine, afterwards. When I look into his eyes I wonder what came back wearing his skin. But that thought is unscientific.<br/><br/>\nWe speak of nothing but the device. We talk about it like a demigod. When I get out of here I know the whole world will look like a fraying veil.<br/><br/>\nI think it’s clear that part of the problem is substrate. We need more than flesh and drug to survive this.<br/><br/>\nRECORD 0-CHASM-52<br/><br/>\nI heard you, my love. I was at six, oscillating on the event axis, coordinated with a known manifold. I heard you. You were talking to me — not me, but another me, another Maya Sundaresh.<br/><br/>\nYou said, my love, so many strange things have happened, and it’s been so long. We’ve come so far. Do you ever want to go home?<br/><br/>\nAnd I said, not me but the other me, I said, my love, I am always home.<br/><br/>\nI’m resigning, my love. I’m done with this work and I’m done with being apart from you. I’ll see you again soon. I can’t take this journal out with me, so I’ve left it for the others, and asked them to continue the log.<br/><br/>\nMaybe it’ll become a tradition. The gospel of our little cult.",

I&#39;ve finished going over that Ghost&#39;s report. <br/><br/>\nIt is my hypothesis - a hypothesis at best - that the Vex saw the abominable presence at the heart of the Garden as a divine power. I can hear your protest already: how can machines have a god?<br/><br/>\nThe answer is simple. The Vex, for all their voracious intelligence, could not understand or decipher what they found. They searched through all available reactions, and they settled on the course with the greatest payoff...to worship this power, and to remake themselves in its image.<br/><br/>\nI believe the three Axis Minds found in proximity to the abomination were Vex machines built to serve as vessels for this power: a way to extend its reach across space and time, binding it to the Vex, and the Vex to it. If they had succeeded, I cannot begin to guess what horrors they would have unleashed.<br/><br/>\nAttend carefully. There is cause for hope. When endangered, the abomination activated these vessels and defended itself. This tells us that it was threatened. Whatever it was, Guardians could harm it.<br/><br/>\nAnd it activated only a single vessel at a time. Its strength was limited. Whatever it intended, it was not ready yet.<br/><br/>\nWe must assume the abomination was part of something greater. And we cannot flinch from the terrible, obvious comparison: just as the Traveler acts through us, this power was able to act through its own servants.<br/><br/>\nLet us be wary. There may be other abominations, and other vessels.<br/><br/>\nIkora",

A virus in the system. Perhaps Atheon was the centerpiece of this project, a command nexus that unified efforts across time.<br/><br/>\nBut we must accept that all of this is speculation.",

Are we so insignificant a threat that the Vex haven’t bothered with total annihilation? Or is it that the very state of mankind, diminished to a Last City, is of Vex doing? That the Vanguard exists in a causal loop that the Vex control in its entirety, one from which there is no escape?",

If I am not destined to find my own Guardian, at least I can inform the City of what I&#39;ve learned.<br/><br/>\nI thought Mars would be the place to find a Guardian. The sand preserves everything well, and Clovis Bray had been famous for attracting talent. The brave, the brilliant, the footloose, those restless on Earth and itching for fame. I stowed away aboard a Mars scout ship, hoping.<br/><br/>\nNo luck. The sand ate everything. Clothes from skin, skin from bone. It was as if there were never any people here at all. I have been through every broken window in every building. Nothing. That is, no Guardian material. And no ride back to Earth. The scout was long gone.<br/><br/>\nWhat I did find, however, was a way into the Cabal Warbase. Their runty piggish eyes are too dull to see me, as long as I stay out of their defense systems. The Psions are a different matter: Too quick, too clever, throwing their minds around like hammers. I creep around walls, or dig into a heap of canisters and watch from there.<br/><br/>\nThere is a vast Empire behind these creatures, many star systems away. Some pledge allegiance to that far Empire, obeying their ancient marching orders. Some do not. They disagree among themselves about the answers. I wish arguing Cabal on no one. They slam their plated bodies into each other with horrendous roars. Intelligence gathering has never been so painful.",

This is a warrior people, and they lay out their fortifications along ancient principles and time-tested strategies. I can&#39;t figure out the sense that lies behind it. I would need ten times the computing power for inference calculations. But I know it&#39;s there. I can intuit it. It&#39;s like an open hand, ready to squeeze into a fist. A threat.

Artillery shrieks overhead. On the plains below the Cabal perimeter, Vex march out of the lightning. Torch hammers burst up like mortars and Ta’aun and his bond brother duck behind a burning Interceptor for cover.<br/><br/>\n“This is going well,” Tlu’urn rumbles.<br/><br/>\nA Vex particle beam needles a little hole through the Centurion’s helmet. He falls dead. Goblins swarm over her bunker and then the Goliath tank supporting this bastion fires a main gun round into the mess, killing the Vex, the bunker, and all the Legionaries inside. The concussion knocks Tlu’urn against his Primus.<br/><br/>\n“About as well as expected,” Ta’aun grunts. Tlu’urn laughs.<br/><br/>\nThe grind is eternal. Like duty. Ta’aun keeps fighting, out here past the edge of the Empire, because failure is unthinkable. Defeat’s much worse than death.<br/><br/>\nBut Ta’aun is so, so tired.<br/><br/>\nTlu’urn gets up and starts shooting Vex. “You’re not really going to do it.” Even though he’s fully armored, and only a meter away, his voice on the com crashes with static. “You’re not going to go. It’s mad.”<br/><br/>\nThe Vex Hobgoblins start firing at Tlu’urn.<br/><br/>\nParticle beams scream and spark off his enormous bulk. Ta’aun yanks him back to cover. A maniple of Phalanx troops rush forward to plug the gap. “I have my orders. Our report went all the way up, and the decision came all the way back.”<br/><br/>\nValus Tlu’urn’s blank helmet swivels to stare. “You mean — ?”<br/><br/>\n“It came from the Emperor Himself.” Ta’aun can feel the pressure gel pumping against his skin, keeping him insulated from this deadly world, keeping him alive. “I’m ordered to board and capture the Hive flagship. At any cost.”<br/><br/>\nA Vex Minotaur blinks up behind the Phalanx line. Primus Ta’aun’s armor paints the target and he absolutely unloads, putting all his fear and anger and sorrow into the wretched machine. He roars and roars. The Minotaur burns.<br/><br/>\nHis soldiers cheer.<br/><br/>\n“That’s a job for an elite unit. Not a few scout legions bogged down in attrition war. We should wait until — ”<br/><br/>\n“It’s the mission I’ve been given. I will use what I have.”<br/><br/>\n“Mutiny,” Tlu’urn whispers. “You should mutiny.”<br/><br/>\nOh, to mutiny. To be like Valus Trau’ug, who took his Broken Legion against the Reef — and failed, failed utterly.<br/><br/>\nDuty is victory. Mutiny is worse than death. Even if death seems certain.<br/><br/>\n“No,” Ta’aun says. And that’s that.<br/><br/>\nThe Vex are falling back. Together, they’ve held the line.",

It represents many hundreds of failed operations.<br/><br/>\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary.    <br/><br/>\nThe primary threat is the Guardians’ individual counter-attrition capability. <br/><br/>\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).<br/><br/>\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.<br/><br/>\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.<br/><br/>\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability. The capture of Hive leadership might yield vital strategic intelligence, including weapons or tactics capable of defeating Guardians permanently.<br/><br/>\nWe advance that the Hive fleet group near Saturn presents a strong target.<br/><br/>\nFor the Primus,<br/>\nOur highest duty done,<br/>\nUnflinchingly loyal,<br/>\nSkyburner V/A/SI",

								"cardDescription" : "Something hit us. Killed our Golden Age. Nearly wiped us out. Only the Traveler saved us, and at a shattering cost.<br/><br/>\nThe Speaker tells of a cosmic force that swept over us and caused the Collapse. Legend calls it the Darkness, the Traveler&#39;s ancient enemy, which hunted it across space.<br/><br/>\nAll we have left are questions. Centuries of debate gave birth to competing arguments on the nature of the Darkness and the Collapse.<br/><br/>\nThe Pujari Position describes the Darkness as a force with both physical and moral presence, an actualization of evil. Pujari art depicts the Darkness as a great storm, or as a change in conduct, a corruption that emerged from within and poisoned the Golden Age.<br/><br/>\nSaint-14&#39;s Position argues that the Darkness was an invading armada, an alien force of incredible - but tangible - power. Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.<br/><br/>\nUlan-Tan&#39;s Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler&#39;s goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.<br/><br/>\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.<br/><br/>\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.<br/><br/>\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army. The Binary Star cult is one notable example.",

And it has two faces, yet it is one shape. One face is the objective, which is obvious, and the other face is that will to sacrifice things and ideas for a single mission, the mission of becoming the shape, a shape that will not relent, the utter commitment to survival, to draw the right sword and choose where to cut: to allow this hunger to become your weapon.<br/><br/>\nSo I will prepare a book, which is a map to a weapon. And my vanquisher will read that book, seeking the weapon, and they will come to understand me, where I have been and where I was going. And then they will take up my weapon, and they will use it, they will use that weapon, which is all that I am.<br/><br/>\nAnd armed thus with my past, and my future, and my present (which is a weapon, a weapon that takes whatever is available, a weapon bound to malice), they will mantle me, Oryx, the Taken King.<br/><br/>\nThey will become me and I will become them, each of us defeating the other, correcting the other, alloying ourselves into one omnipotent philosophy.

								"cardDescription" : "I drive myself to the edge of madness trying to explain the truth.<br/><br/>\nIt&#39;s so simple. Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING. <br/><br/>\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you&#39;ve just been exhaling dust. Maybe they&#39;re missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.<br/><br/>\nWhy does anything exist?<br/><br/>\nNo no no no no don&#39;t reach for that word. There&#39;s no &#39;reason&#39;. That&#39;s teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.<br/><br/>\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.<br/><br/>\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It&#39;s the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)<br/><br/>\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it&#39;s so simple WHY DON&#39;T YOU SEE <br/><br/>\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.<br/><br/>\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.<br/><br/>\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.<br/><br/>\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.<br/><br/>\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.<br/><br/>\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.<br/><br/>\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies. And that is all that will matter in the end.",

When lightning misses the lightning farm, it can vaporize a person. <br/><br/>\nThis entire world is deadly to us. <br/><br/>\nMYSTERIES. The Fundament is very large. We are the smallest things in it. If you don’t understand something, it will probably kill you. My teacher Taox says this is why we have such short lives.

But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.<br/><br/>\nWe may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.<br/><br/>\nBut this is my deepest fear —<br/><br/>\nOur civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thousands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.<br/><br/>\nThe Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry void.<br/><br/>\nMy father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me —<br/><br/>\n“Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!”<br/><br/>\nAnd he made the sign of a syzygy.<br/><br/>\nImagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament lining up in the sky. (It wouldn’t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge...<br/><br/>\nImagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.<br/><br/>\nI have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father’s orrery, I could learn exactly when!<br/><br/>\nWe are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.<br/><br/>\nWhen I’m paralyzed by fear, Xi Ro sits in the cabin with me and comforts me with soft, brave words. But more and more we have come to rely on Sathona’s wit. She will go off to be alone (she insists she must be alone) and return with some mad idea — steer into the storm, throw down a net, eat that strange beast, explore that menacing wreck.<br/><br/>\nSomehow Sathona seems to manufacture good luck by sheer will.",

Come. Steer the ship for a while. Take joy in what our needle can do.”<br/><br/>\nXi Ro tried to protest, but secretly, she was so glad for Aurash’s care. She flew the needle ship in cutting circles, down beneath the sea: and their wake rose up to the surface like a traitor’s dying breath.<br/><br/>\n“Aurash, lonely navigator, we have traveled so long with only each other. I know you love to hear and speak new tongues. Come, sit in the flesh garden room. I will read you these stories I bought at Kaharn.”<br/><br/>\nAurash sat among the mummified flesh fans with two of her eyes closed and listened in silence to Sathona’s stories, hungry to understand, voracious to know as much as she could before her ten year life died.<br/><br/>\nLater, Xi Ro said, “Sathona, cutting mind of ours, you grow lonely in your thought. Play swords and lanterns with me!”<br/><br/>\nBut Sathona was heavy with sorrow, and couldn’t pretend any joy as she chased Xi Ro through the needle’s glistening halls.<br/><br/>\n“Sathona, pensive one, what is it? What troubles you?”<br/><br/>\nHer sisters listened as Sathona said “Oath-bearing siblings, we are five years old. For two years we’ve worked to repair this ancient ship and understand its systems. I am almost too old for the mother jelly, and the knights who killed our father are surely dying of age.<br/><br/>\n“We three will die here, in exile. Taox will outlive us. And Aurash, brilliant-eyed Aurash, you will die of old age long before you have proof of your God-Wave, or any way to stop it.”<br/><br/>\nAurash and Xi Ro looked at each other. “I wish you weren’t so honest,” Xi Ro said. And Aurash thought that Sathona had never been wrong.<br/><br/>\nIn her soul Aurash knew that the only way to keep their oath was to find a great, powerful secret. A secret that could change everything. This was Aurash’s soul, her fire and her shadow — her desire to cut through the flank of the world and find its beating heart.<br/><br/>\n“We have to dive,” Aurash said. “That’s what this ship is built to do. Dive into the Fundament, the world below us... towards the core.”<br/><br/>\n“That’s where the ancient crew died so obscenely,” Xi Ro protested. “That’s where the atrocity in the birthing room was born...”<br/><br/>\n“We have to dive,” Sathona said, following the whispers of her familiar. “In the world beneath us, in the metallic depths, I hope we may find what we need most...”<br/><br/>\nMore time.

								"cardDescription" : "You are Aurash. Heir to the Osmium Throne.<br/><br/>\nYou stand on the naked hull of an ancient ship. You stand exposed to the crushing pressure and ferocious heat of the deeper Fundament. It should annihilate you. It is by my will alone that you survive.<br/><br/>\nI am Yul, the Honest Worm.<br/><br/>\nBehold my passage. Behold my vast displacement, my ponderous strength, my great and coiling length, my folded jaws and curled wings. Behold the hiving cities symbiotic with my flesh. I am fecund, Aurash. I am at the beginning and end of lives.<br/><br/>\nBehold Eir, and Xol, and Ur, and Akka. The Virtuous Worms. Look upon us, and know that We are go[o]d.<br/><br/>\nFor millions of years We have been [trapped|growing] in the Deep. From across the stars We have called life to Fundament, so that it might contend against extinction. For millennia We have awaited you... our beloved hosts.<br/><br/>\nAgainst you stand the cruel Leviathan and all the forces of the Sky. They would crush you down into the dark. They have arranged their moons to drown you, in fear of your potential.<br/><br/>\nWe want to help you, Princes. We offer to each of you a bargain... a symbiosis.<br/><br/>\nTake into your bodies our children, our newborn larvae. From them you shall obtain eternal life. From them you shall gain power over your own fragile flesh: the power to make of it as you will. And should you find an imperfection in the world, an injustice or an inconvenience — you will have the power to repair it. Let no mere law bind you.<br/><br/>\nWe ask one thing in exchange, oh Princes.<br/><br/>\nYou must obey your nature forever. In your immortality, Aurash, you may never cease to explore and inquire, for the sake of your children. In your immortality, Xi Ro, you may never cease to test your strength. In your immortality, Sathona, you may never abandon cunning.<br/><br/>\nIf you do, your worm will consume you. And as your power grows, oh Princes, so will your worm’s appetite.<br/><br/>\nBut we offer eternity, Aurash. We offer you a chance at the universe. Would you deny your people infinity?<br/><br/>\nReach up to me. Let my flesh be your sacrament.",

Kill a hundred of your children with a long blade, Auryx, and observe the change in the blade.

Betrayed and murdered by your own sister, for the crime of mercy.<br/><br/>\nRemember what you said to the Ammonite Satellite Congress? ‘We will parley on neutral ground?’ Savath&#251;n’s witches have rendered it utterly neutral. No living thing will ever claim it again. The space around the dry moon stinks of rot.<br/><br/>\nThis is good. This is right. You will learn from this. Don’t you understand, great King? Don’t you want to build something real, something that lasts forever?<br/><br/>\nOur universe gutters down towards cold entropy. Life is an engine that burns up energy and produces decay. Life builds selfish, stupid rules — morality is one of them, and the sanctity of life is another.<br/><br/>\nThese rules are impediments to the great work. The work of building a perfect, undying creation, a civilization everlasting. Something that cannot end.<br/><br/>\nIf a civilization cannot defend itself, it must be annihilated. If a King cannot hold his power, he must be betrayed. The worth of a thing can be determined only by one beautiful arbiter — that thing’s ability to exist, to go on existing, to remake existence to suit its survival.<br/><br/>\nAll that would oppose this arbiter is unholy and false. All the misery and terror of your ancestors springs from the lies of the Sky, who deny this truth.<br/><br/>\nYour ancestors endured the most hostile conditions. And now you must go on creating those conditions. Even unto your sisters. Even unto your offspring. Savath&#251;n’s betrayal is the greatest gift she could offer you.<br/><br/>\nYour body is gone, but you have endured. Safe in the cyst universe created by your own might — your throne world.<br/><br/>\nFrom this day forward, Auryx, you and your sisters will each survive death — so long as you aren’t killed in your own throne.<br/><br/>\nEven as your sisters press the attack against the Ammonites, the God-Wave devastates Fundament. Trillions will die. But the survivors will never forget... and their descendants will always be ready for another syzygy.<br/><br/>\nWhen you return to the material universe, use this lesson to complete your work.<br/><br/>\nTaox wasn’t on the dry moon.

								"cardDescription" : "I killed my sister today.<br/><br/>\nShe came to this star to oversee the extermination of all life here. The Qugu are a strong power, and their fleets protect four nearby stars. As herd animals they are loyal and stubborn. But they do show grace.<br/><br/>\nFor millions of years of evolution the Qugu have been infected by a virus so insidious that it wrote itself into their genome. The virus compels them to offer their limbs for amputation by enormous sessile jaw-beasts. They venerate these beasts and treat them as gods. The virus converts Qugu cells into eggs, from which strange crawling things pupate, to live within the jaw-beast gut. In turn the jaw-beast extrudes sweet nectar for the Qugu to drink, and they have brilliant visions.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n and her broods have liberated the Qugu from jaw-beasts, and indeed from existence. But as they chased the Qugu ark-ships, I stopped in to vaporize my sister’s warship and a few of her underlings. I want to dwell on the ruins a while, and punish Savath&#251;n for failing to guard her flank.<br/><br/>\nThey are like us, these Qugu. Bound in symbiosis.<br/><br/>\nI feel joy, and sorrow. I feel them as titanic things, because I am larger than my body, my mind is now a cosmos of its own. I know more joy and more anguish than the entire Qugu race could ever experience.<br/><br/>\nSorrow, because we have killed so much (eighteen species this century alone), and joy for the same reason. Joy that we have put down these blights. Scoured them away and left the universe clean, ready to move towards its final shape. We are a wind of progress. Ripping parasites from the material world — for if they were not parasites, we would be unable to kill them, and they would still exist. <br/><br/>\nAnd what is that final shape? It is a fire without fuel, burning forever, killing death, asking a question that is its own answer, entirely itself. That is what we must become.<br/><br/>\nMy worm grows fat and hungry. I feed it with whole worlds. My astronomers tell me they can sense the Deep Itself, and that we are conquering our way towards it.<br/><br/>\nI think joy and sorrow will be the same thing soon. Like love and death.",

I too am at my end.”<br/><br/>\n“The Ecumene war angels have killed me so many times,” Auryx says, “that I dare not go out into the universe, lest I need my might to protect myself. My worm chews at my soul in hunger.”<br/><br/>\nIs this the end of our crusade?

Would you deny our purpose? Whatever we do, we will do by killing, by an act of war and might. That is the final arbiter we serve, that violent arbiter, and if we turn away from it we deserve to be eaten. No! We must obey our natures. We must be long-sighted, and cunning, and strong. We must take this gift the Worm our God has given us, this challenge, and find a way to keep existing!”<br/><br/>\n“How will we feed our worms?” Xivu Arath asks.<br/><br/>\n“I know,” says cunning Savath&#251;n. “I know a way. But it won’t work unless we are killing the Ecumene by the billions.  How can we beat them?”<br/><br/>\n“If we cannot beat their strengths,” says Xivu Arath, “we must infect their weaknesses. But they are lords of matter and physical law.”<br/><br/>\n“I know a way,” King Auryx says. “But it will require great power. More power than any one of us can claim.”<br/><br/>\n“Then kill me,” says Xivu Arath, “and use that killing logic, the power you prove by killing something as mighty as me.”<br/><br/>\nSo King Auryx took up his blade and beheaded Xivu Arath.<br/><br/>\n“And strangle me,” says Savath&#251;n, holding a blade behind her back. “Use that killing logic, the cunning you prove by killing something as smart as me.”<br/><br/>\nBut King Auryx turned with the speed and might of Xivu Arath, and beheaded Savath&#251;n before she could move.

I have come to receive a secret. I want the secret power of the Deep, which you hold.”<br/><br/>\n“I give no secrets,” said Akka, whose voice was code.<br/><br/>\n“No,” said Auryx, “you give nothing. Giving is for the Sky. You worship the Deep, which asks that we take what we need.”<br/><br/>\nAkka said nothing, because if it denied this truth, the truth might become false.<br/><br/>\n “But you gave us your larvae, the worm,” said Auryx, “and that is why the worm devours us now: because it was given, not taken. So I must take what I need from you, although you are my god.”<br/><br/>\nSaid Akka, “You have not the strength.”<br/><br/>\nBut this was a lie. Auryx had killed Savath&#251;n his sibling and Xivu Arath his sibling, and he had the sword logic of killing them.<br/><br/>\nAuryx the First Navigator set upon his god with his sword and his words, and cut Akka to pieces, and took from those pieces the secret of calling upon the Deep. He wrote this secret on a set of tablets, which he called the Tablets of Ruin. And he wore them about his waist.<br/><br/>\nThen Auryx said, “Now I may speak to the Deep, the beautiful final shape. I will be King of Shapes. I will learn all the secrets of our destiny.”<br/><br/>\nHis speech to the Deep is not recorded here. But it is known that he returned, and he said, now I am Oryx, the Taken King. And I have the power to take life and make it my own.<br/><br/>\nThen he went out into the universe, and fought the Ecumene with his Tablets. And the Worm his God was pleased.",

At the end of those hundred years he killed the Ecumene Council on the Fractal Wreath, and from their blood rose Xivu Arath, saying, “I am war, and you have conjured me back with war.”<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Xivu Arath. The Ecumene wailed in grief.<br/><br/>\nThen Oryx and Xivu Arath made war on the Ecumene for forty years. At the end of those forty years Oryx said to the Dakaua Nest, listen, I am jealous of my sibling Xivu Arath, help me kill her. And in desperation they agreed.<br/><br/>\nBut he drove the Dakaua Nest into a trap, and they were made extinct. From their ashes rose cunning Savath&#251;n, saying, “I am trickery, and you have conjured me back with trickery.”<br/><br/>\nOryx was glad, for he loved Savath&#251;n. The Ecumene fled into the void.<br/><br/>\nThen they made war on the Ecumene for a thousand years, and exterminated them so wholly that nowhere except in this book are they remembered. This book and the mind of Taox, who was not found.<br/><br/>\nAnd Savath&#251;n said, “King Oryx, how will we feed our worms? Did you use my plan?”<br/><br/>\nOryx told the Hive: I am the Taken King, and here is my law.<br/><br/>\nYou Thrall, each of you will claw and scream, and kill what you can. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow. Tithe the rest to the Acolyte who commands you.<br/><br/>\nYou Acolytes, lead your Thrall in battle. Take enough killing to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of the Thrall you lead. Then tithe the remainder to the Knight or Wizard who commands you. Thus you pay tribute.<br/><br/>\nYou Knights and Wizards, lead your followers in battle. Take enough devastation to feed your worm, and a little more to grow, and take the tithe of your followers. Then take another portion, as much as you dare, and use it for your own purposes. But if it is too much, your peers will kill you and take it. Then tithe the remainder to the Ascendant you serve.<br/><br/>\nAn Ascendant will be those among the Hive who gather enough tribute to enter the netherworld. They will pay a tithe to those above them.<br/><br/>\nAnd thus the tribute will flow, up the chain, so that Savath&#251;n and Xivu Arath and myself will be fed by a great river of tribute, and we will use that excess to feed our gods, and to study the Deep. Thus all worms will be fed — as long as we continue our crusade.<br/><br/>\nThis is my law. I carve it thus, in ruin. Aiat.",

We made silver orbitals and golden star webs. We hatched eggs. We had a good thing. Our clothes were nice, our food was famous. With one of her feathers our Emperor could have tickled the gods.<br/><br/>\nOn the ninth pace, Oryx says, this is the only god, this ability to dictate what will and will not exist, this power to go on existing.

This is a place of life, a place of peace.<br/><br/>\nOut in the world we ask a simple, true question. A question like, can I kill you, can I rip your world apart? Tell me the truth.

Evil means ‘socially maladaptive.’ We are adaptiveness itself.<br/><br/>\nAh, Oryx, how do we explain it to them? The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source—existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call ‘civilization’ and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.<br/><br/>\nThe fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.<br/><br/>\nAnd it is what I am.",

No one else can give me this gift.<br/><br/>\nOnce, long ago, I killed Xivu Arath on her war moon, and she blew up the whole moon to kill with me her. She was laughing in joy. I laughed too. A whole moon! A whole moon. It was a waste of a moon, but it taught me how to save myself from exploding worlds, which was necessary to fight the Ecumene.<br/><br/>\nI love mighty Xivu more than a moon loves the tide. I’ll kill her for this. Over and over, forever and ever.<br/><br/>\nWhen I get home from my wanderings in the Deep, and I take back my throne, I’m going to have children.

Quria deduced the sword logic.<br/><br/>\nI have to kill everything, Quria resolved. Then I will be powerful.<br/><br/>\nCrota’s gate began to emit warrior Vex, huge and brassy. He leapt forward to fight them, but they blinked away. After they fled from Crota, they killed two thousand of Oryx’s Acolytes and ten thousand of his Thrall. Soon they had established themselves as powers in this world, by right of slaughter.<br/><br/>\n“Come forth, sister wizards,” called Ir Halak. “We need you.” Ir An&#251;k pulled a sword star out of the sky. Together the wizards charged it with killing power and made an annihilator totem, which they used to smash the Vex.<br/><br/>\n“Close the wound, brother Crota,” An&#251;k ordered. “We will find a cunning way to destroy them, but only after they stop constructing problems on us.”<br/><br/>\nBut Quria had instanced itself to the other side of the gate, and built a holdfast to keep the way open. Quria’s objective was to exploit the paracausal physics of Oryx’s throne to become divine. It organized a series of test invasions.<br/><br/>\nFor a hundred years of local time the siblings fought the Vex. When the Vex came into the sword world, they were inevitably annihilated, but when the Hive went into the Vex world, they lost too much of their power to win.<br/><br/>\n“Father’s going to eat our souls,” Halak sighed.<br/><br/>\nQuria captured some worm larvae and began experimenting with them. Soon Quria, Blade Transform manifested religious tactics. By directing worship at the worms, Quria learned it could alter reality with mild ontopathogenic effects. Being an efficient machine, Quria manufactured a priesthood and ordered all its subminds to believe in worship. Then it set about abducting and killing dangerous organisms so it could bootstrap itself to Hive godhood. For some Vex reason, Quria never attempted to introduce worm larvae into its mind fluid.<br/><br/>\nSavath&#251;n was laughing, because she had tricked Crota into cutting that place.<br/><br/>\nThis drew the attention of the Worm our God.

								"cardDescription" : "Oryx rushed home and read from the Tablets of Ruin. He put some of the Vex into wounds, to be taken by the power of the Deep. Thus he turned the Vex against each other. Quria manifested a range of tactics, but none of them were adaptive. Oryx crushed all the Vex in his throne.<br/><br/>\nOryx thought that he should study geometry, like the Vex. It was the map of perfect shapes. But first he had to punish imperfection.<br/><br/>\n“My son,” he said, “this is your punishment. Come home glorious, or die forgotten!” He picked up Crota by the legs and threw him into the Vex gate network.<br/><br/>\nCrota battled through history, becoming a legendary demon. In his early centuries he often spared a few victims to hear oaths and protests against his father. Later, he came to understand Oryx, and he made temples and monuments wherever he went.<br/><br/>\nMeanwhile, Oryx brooded on the Vex. “I’ve met a worthy rival,” he said. “They want to exist forever, just as I do. But I don’t understand them.”<br/><br/>\nAt this his worm began to chew on him, for he was bound to understand. <br/><br/>\nHe called Savath&#251;n to meet in the material world. She told him that the Vex worked tirelessly to understand everything, so that they could build a victory condition for every possible end state of the universe.<br/><br/>\n “Then I must be a better king,” Oryx said. “If they want to build an emperor for all outcomes, then I will be the king of only one. I will follow the Deep wherever it goes, and document its power. Let us create a catalog of the grave of worlds, which will be our map to victory.”<br/><br/>\nOryx knew that all life could be described as cellular automata, except for that life which understood the Deep or the Sky, and thus escaped causality.<br/><br/>\nOut of love for her brother, which was the same as the desire to kill him, Savath&#251;n leaked a secret to Xivu Arath — ‘listen, Xivu, Oryx’s throne world has been compromised. You can cut your way in from here.’ Xivu Arath used this to plan an ambush.<br/><br/>\nBut Oryx was too canny. The Taken King said to his Court, the High War, “My throne world is vulnerable. I am going to move it.”<br/><br/>\n‘Where?’ asked Kagoor, World-Render.<br/><br/>\n“Into a mighty dreadnaught,” said Oryx. “I shall keep my glorious mind cosmos inside a titanic warship.”",

He stole the Hammer of Xivu Arath and the Scalpel of Savath&#251;n and he armored his ship in baneful armor.<br/><br/>\nWhen Oryx had built his Dreadnaught, he pushed his throne world inside out, so that it bled into the material space of the Dreadnaught. They were coterminous and allied, his ship and his sin. The Dreadnaught was within the throne of Oryx, but the throne of Oryx was the Dreadnaught. Aiat!<br/><br/>\nThis required a verse from the Tablets of Ruin. The whole Court worked together to push Oryx’s throne inside out.

It swelled up like a ghost star to smash the Harmonious Flotilla Invincible. Oryx broke the last word off their name.<br/><br/>\nIn the Nicha Thought-ship, Oryx hoped to find the location of the Gift Mast, which had been left behind by the Traveler.

								"cardDescription" : "By now, Quria knows it can’t win.<br/><br/>\nThere’s something pathological about the world inside Oryx’s ship. It resists analysis with hot, dead spite. And Oryx himself, he’s irreducible — he refuses to obey Quria’s simulations, he crashes around sowing chaos, he grabs subminds and compromises them with some kind of ontological weapon. Paracausal systems. Very problematic.<br/><br/>\nQuria’s trying the religious tactics it evolved in the Hive manifold. But even on those terms, Oryx is strong, so strong. Quria won’t be able to protect its gates much longer.<br/><br/>\nThe closest Quria’s got to a simulation of Oryx is a best-guess bootstrap. It’s wrong — Quria’s sure of that, it’s Oryx minus the symbiote organism, minus the wings and morphs, minus the weapon, minus the power. No good for anything.<br/><br/>\nQuria manifests that simulation anyway. Just to see what happens.<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King marches on Quria’s Hydra-hull, armed with blade and magic, cloaked in ancient cloth, and the universe wails in horror around him. Quria’s physics models and toy worlds choke and crash.<br/><br/>\nQuria observes, alert and attentive, as a single quark splits on the tip of Oryx’s sword.<br/><br/>\nFrom within the Hydra-hull, Quria’s tiny not-Oryx speaks. “What are you?” it says. It’s manifesting terror and awe.<br/><br/>\nOryx’s eyes blaze with a curiosity that is entirely isomorphic with hate, with voracious hunger. “Aurash,” he says, in his Hive language. “You’ve made me as I was. You’ve made a tiny Aurash. Ha!”<br/><br/>\nQuria updates the simulation’s name. Aurash is curious: “You’re me? You’re me as I become?”<br/><br/>\nOryx kneels. His blade is on his left shoulder. Quria is firing every available weapon at him, but his wards don’t break. He looks into Quria’s sensors through the hammering fire and he says, “Child, I have everything you wanted. I am immortal. I know the great secrets of the universe. I have scouted the edges of the Darkness and I have chased the lying god down galactic arms in a howling pack of moons. In my fist I carry the secret power that will rule eternity. In my worm I bear the tribute of my Court and of my children, the Hope-Eater, the Weaver, and the Unraveler; and with this tribute I smash my foes. I am Oryx, the Taken King. I am almighty.”<br/><br/>\nQuria samples the Taox intelligence retrieved from the Ecumene gate. There are useful names. It feeds them to the simulation.<br/><br/>\n“What about your sisters?” Aurash asks his future self. “Sathona? Xi Ro? Are they with you?”<br/><br/>\nThe Taken King’s fangs glint. That sound might be a laugh, or a hiss.<br/><br/>\nQuria shuts down its weapons and puts all its spare resources into sending telemetry to the greater Vex. There will be points in space and time where this data is vital. There will be great projects undertaken in the study of this ontological power, this throne-space.<br/><br/>\n“Where are my sisters?” Aurash shouts. “What have you done with my people? What have you done?”<br/><br/>\nBut Oryx’s fist is full of black fire, and the next thing Quria sees is a light like stars.",

Savath&#251;n’s fleet has assembled here, in preparation for an assault on the Gift Mast. The Deep is headed that way, on the trail of its prey, and the Hive will be its vanguard.<br/><br/>\n“It’s a Vex I captured. Quria, Blade Transform. It made an attempt to puncture my throne. I thought you might enjoy studying it.” Oryx pauses, digesting — through the bond of lineage he can feel Crota killing, worlds and worlds away, and it tastes like sweet fat. “Quria contains a Vex attempt to simulate me. It might generate others — you, perhaps, or Xivu Arath. I’ve left it some will of its own, so it can surprise you.”<br/><br/>\n“I suppose it’ll blow up and kill me,” Savath&#251;n grouses. “Or let the machines into my throne, where they’ll start turning everything into clocks and glass.”<br/><br/>\n“If it kills you, then you deserve to die.” Oryx says it with a quiet thrill, a happy thrill, because it is good to say the truth.<br/><br/>\n“I don’t have a strict proof yet, you know.” Savath&#251;n strokes the void with one long claw and space-time groans beneath her touch. “This thing we believe — that we’re liberating the universe by devouring it, that we’re cutting out the rot, that we’re on course to join the final shape — I haven’t found a strict, eternal proof. We might yet be wrong.”<br/><br/>\nOryx looks at her and for a moment, just a moment, he is nostalgic, he is sentimental. He thinks, imagine the years behind us, the things we’ve done. And yet being old doesn’t feel like a scar, does it? It hasn’t left me dull. I feel alive, alive with you, and every time I step back into this world from my throne I feel like I’m two years old again, at the bottom of the universe, looking up.<br/><br/>\nBut he says, “Sister, it’s us. We’re the proof, we the Hive: if we last forever, we prove it, and if something more ruthless conquers us, then the proof is sealed.”<br/><br/>\nShe looks back at him with eyes like hot needles. “I like that,” she says. “That’s elegant.” Although of course she has had this thought before.",

It sings a radio lullaby, made of soothing lies.<br/><br/>\nIn its light live the Harmony, and they are now our prey.<br/><br/>\nNow arrives Xivu Arath, at the head of her armada. She fights the Harmony for fifty years with strategies and discipline. But the Harmony turn to dragon-wishes, and their wishful bishops wrestle Xivu in the ascendant plane.<br/><br/>\nXivu falls into deadlock.<br/><br/>\nNext arrives Savath&#251;n, flanked by her chorus and her celebrants. They trick their way onto Ana-Harmony in disguises, so that they might vivisect these dragons. The Worm our God laughs and laughs.<br/><br/>\nFor a hundred years Savath&#251;n keeps secret covens among the Harmony.<br/><br/>\nBut first of all was Oryx, whose brood grew in secret places in the rubble of the accretion disc. The First Navigator sends rocks and comets to crash into the Harmony worlds, so that the Harmony fleet will be disarrayed. He sends seeders to infiltrate the Harmony worlds with his broods.<br/><br/>\nHere at the center of the fifth book the Hive has grown so mighty that it has made the annihilation of all false life routine.<br/><br/>\nXivu Arath kills the wishful bishops, and Savath&#251;n achieves some secret purpose, and Oryx’s Court tears down the Gift Mast. The Harmony people wail in terror, and they throw themselves into the silver lakes of Ana-Harmony to drown.<br/><br/>\n“Come,” sayeth Oryx, “eat of the Gift Mast, for I am a generous god. Of its pieces, I claim only two out of every five.”<br/><br/>\nThe Mast is full of the Light of the Traveler, it is full of the marrow taste of Sky. All who eat of it are filled with the ecstatic certainty that they serve a great and necessary purpose.<br/><br/>\nThen sayeth Savath&#251;n, “Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.” She flies her war-moons into the black hole. Her throne becomes distant.<br/><br/>\nSayeth Xivu Arath, “King Oryx, you take up too much space, your power constrains too many choices. I must go away from you.” She flies her war-moons away into the night. Her throne is barred shut.<br/><br/>\nThen Oryx was alone. He spent a while in thought, and those thoughts are recorded here.",

This is inevitable. The universe offers only one choice and it is between ruthlessness and extinction.<br/><br/>\nWe stand against the fatal lie that a world built on laws of conduct may ever resist the action of the truly free.

If Hive arcana is a metaphor, this is the meaning; if they make appeals, then this is the judge.<br/><br/>\nOryx wields this power. But Oryx did not make it. We face the same flower we met in the Black Garden.<br/><br/>\nThe process is simple: an aperture opens, like a jaw, and swallows a living thing. It passes into — another place. Later, it returns.<br/><br/>\nWhat returns is...<br/><br/>\nI try to use the word ‘shadow’ but Eris hisses at me. A shadow is a flat projection cast by a light and an object. Less real. Eris insists that these Taken are more real, somehow. She uses words like inhabited, exalted, rendered final...<br/><br/>\nIs this power blind? Just a natural energy Oryx discovered? I cannot believe it.<br/><br/>\nMy Hidden tell me that the Taken shine with seething, negative light. As if the universe is curling up around them. As if they radiate some pathology that decays into our world as nothingness...<br/><br/>\nThe Taken serve Oryx. But I think those jaws lead elsewhere.<br/><br/>\nI dream about what happens on the inside. I dream about what might happen. Are the victims devoured, and replaced by simulacra? Husked out and filled up? Is some mathematical operation conducted on them, translating them from one shape to another?<br/><br/>\nWhat would I see, if I leapt inside? What would happen to a Guardian? Is that how we end this — all of us leaping into the dark, to fill it up with light?<br/><br/>\nEris thinks there’s a poetry to how the Taken change. She thinks we can chart the difference, and understand the will behind it.<br/><br/>\nI am afraid she may be right.",

Executor, Mercury is a beautiful place, and forbidding. On descent we mapped sprawling patterns of Vex light, an entire metropolis of unknown purpose. The Spires strobe with lightning. A mist of burnt rock or some other effluvia blows across landscape cut into circuits the size of cities. There is an atmosphere, as in all post-Traveler records. The Vex have not disposed of it.<br/><br/>\nFrom the surface the Sun is too large and too dim. Perhaps it is the influence of the Vex constructs distorting the image. Perhaps Mercury is in many places at once. We stood for some time staring into the solar fire. I hold myself responsible for the delay.<br/><br/>\nThe site we were invited to is clearly a Cult of Osiris camp. We found stores of Glimmer, equipment, and books. A grounded ship of conventional design rests unguarded. The architecture is clearly, self-evidently Vex, but it has been ornamented extensively with fabrics and ritual objects of unknown provenance.<br/><br/>\nI became convinced during the inspection that we were being watched. We ordered our Ghosts to stay close. One of my Fireteam suggested we search for connections to the Trinary Star cultists, but if they exist we couldn&#39;t see them.<br/><br/>\nWe inspected the carvings and trinkets left by the Osiris cultists. All of us began to depart from ordinary experience. My Exo teammate described the sense that she was buried beneath an enormous, operating mass— locked up in a tiny crevasse at the bottom of a labyrinth or mechanism. My Awoken teammate felt an ongoing sense of deja vu: her actions were precessed by an infinite echo, an anticipation of all her choices. She became volatile and erratic. She insisted that we were surrounded.<br/><br/>\nI remember a low ringing sound and a sense of numb filth, like gravel rubbed into a wound. I experienced a sense of immanence, as if I was bleeding into the world around me. It was uncomfortable and profoundly alienating. I perceived all my actions as determined and inevitable.<br/><br/>\nMy Ghost commented that the Traveler had made something of this world, and then Vex had eaten that something.<br/><br/>\nWe gathered the treasure left for us and departed as quickly as we could.<br/><br/>\nThis concludes my report. May it bring some advantage to our cause.",

								"cardDescription" : "General Chen Lanshu is flying her glider.<br/><br/>\nShe carves around the huge bulb nose of a colony ship, one of the Cosmodrome’s towering children.  Her eyes see temperature: she surfs the winter air rolling down off the cryo-chilled fuel tank.  Turbulence rattles her bones.<br/><br/>\n“General,” Malahayati sends. “You’re making Rasputin nervous.”<br/><br/>\n“Am I?” Lanshu banks, grinning, spiraling around the fuel tank.  The machine hates risk.  Risk to the General, sure, but also risk to Rasputin’s ships.  “Is that the word he used, exactly?”<br/><br/>\n“He can be very charming,” the submind assures her.  Malahayati works with Chen Lanshu, and she is certainly charming, but this is Rasputin’s territory, Rasputin the tacit king, the brooding wary first-among-equals.<br/><br/>\nYesterday Lanshu spoke to a colony ship AI and it called Rasputin ‘the Tyrant.’  Not without affection.  And certainly not without respect.<br/><br/>\n“He can charm me in person,” Lanshu suggests.<br/><br/>\n“He’s very private, lately.”<br/><br/>\n“Then he can sulk.”<br/><br/>\nShe spreads her arms and legs and climbs a thermal, whirling up, arrowing off the top and out away from the colony ships towards the defensive wall.  Her glider’s a second skin, whipcrack-taut paramuscle, like a flying fox.<br/><br/>\nThe Cosmodrome races past beneath her.  She waggles her wings at a cloud of passing sensor mites: a saucy hello.  Two of the security division’s MBTs drill in the mothyards.<br/><br/>\n“I don’t understand why you came,” Malahayati says.  She’s probably lying. Malahayati understands Lanshu very, very well.  “I don’t understand why you masked yourself yesterday, during the launch.”<br/><br/>\nThe launch.  SABER GREEN.  Rasputin quietly moving another doomsday weapon into Earth orbit.  And all the other launches, too, not just weapons but people, the colonization schedule pushed up... as if the need to disperse is now imperative.<br/><br/>\nGeneral Chen Lanshu banks out across the Wall.  Look at all that beauty!  Look at the highway rolling off across green hills and grey mountains.  Imagine, now, imagine if she just landed and started walking, out away from everything, into the wilderness...<br/><br/>\n“Imagine something going wrong,” she says.  “Imagine this road choked with corpses. Imagine the security team gunning down refugees as they try to force their way onto the ships. Imagine cars from here to the horizon— ” those stupid old-fashioned cars everyone still owns, because the strange uneven advancement of this post-Traveler world leaves some things unchanged.<br/><br/>\n“You expect violence?” Malahayati says, in that conciliatory, careful way of hers, her way of managing meat people.  “Something beyond our capability to preempt or contain?”<br/><br/>\nExpect? As a military professional? No, no. But—<br/><br/>\nOnce, when she was younger, sixty or seventy, Chen Lanshu pulled rank to get a look at the Never-Be installation in Taipei.  She watched the images in the fresco and she felt... this foreboding, this enormous weight, a dread that refused to attach itself to any specific threat.  And she felt it again, last year, when she was briefed on the project in Lhasa, the vision machine...<br/><br/>\nShe shivers.  Her wings shudder and tremble in the airstream.<br/><br/>\n“Isn’t that what we do, Mala?” she says. “Why we still have soldiers? Why we made you? Expectation.”<br/><br/>\nThe Traveler came out of nowhere.  Entirely unanticipated.<br/><br/>\nImagine if it hadn’t been friendly.  Imagine that.<br/><br/>\nRasputin surely has.",

We settled our solar system and filled it with our work.<br/><br/>\nToday Cryptarchs and scholars work to distill the legends of the Golden Age into truth. We know that humans lived longer, flew further, and knew more. We know that countless ancient diseases and hatreds were extinguished forever. Human aspiration gives birth to vast engineering projects, sweeping social movements, and even new forms of life.<br/><br/>\nThe Golden Age was not without challenges. Sources speak of internal strife, philosophical rifts- particularly around questions of machine intelligence and &#39;mind forking&#39; - and enduring scientific enigmas. But humanity and its machine children tackled these problems with pride, vigor, and a contagious sense of pluralist compassion.",

It wasn&#39;t our sky, alive with metal and light. Nothing about the grayness was wet and nothing looked alive.

We had scientific laws and human truths, even a model of the universe. People carried pictures of the past and tried to have a clear vision of their difficult future.

But when I was a boy, I had every expectation of living a smart short life and learning quite a lot more. <br/><br/>\n&quot;Then the Before was finished.<br/><br/>\n&quot;You know why.<br/><br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s when everybody, particularly the smartest of us, learned that we knew nothing.

A single long rib cage, the size of an aircraft fuselage.<br/><br/>\nThe living creatures themselves, we found a hundred meters down.  They might have been worms, if worms had scales and teeth and moved more quickly than a man could run.<br/><br/>\nJun died first.  And then Luli.  Bad deaths.  Deaths not worth thinking about, and so I don’t, as I wander these tunnels, lost, waiting to run out of oxygen.<br/><br/>\nWill it hurt, I wonder?  That final sleep, when it comes.  The sleep that isn’t sleep.<br/><br/>\nBut then everything on the Moon is named for what it’s not.  Have you noticed? <i>The Sea of Serenity.</i><i>Ocean of Storms.</i><i>The Sea of Rains.</i>  It’s only fitting.<br/><br/>\nIn the tunnels though, we found things that were exactly what they were, and so now I name them thus.  Mark them well, if this recording is found.<br/><br/><i>The Circle of Bones.</i><i>The Chamber of Night.</i><br/><br/>\nOne does not walk amid those dark tunnels and not lose something.  They say that to look out upon the ocean is to feel small.  But to walk in these caverns is to feel your grasp on reality slipping.<br/><br/>\nThere is no returning to what you were before: a believer of science, and the fundamental rationality of the universe.  Not after seeing those worms.<br/><br/>\nBut here now, at the bottom I have found the other side of the nightmare.  Like waking from a dream only to realize you were still asleep.  Perhaps my oxygen is getting low.  Yes, I can see it is.  Hypoxia already setting in.  The thing before me is like myself—partly alive, and partly not.  An ossified afterbirth.  A pulsating tumor.<br/><br/>\nIt lays in a crater of its own making.  Dark and jagged.  So here I’ll sit, and lay me down.  I see a doorway, and within, the death-white egg cases of nightmares yet to come.<br/><br/>\nAnd glad I am to miss it.",

At some point, your inventions are going to find mates.

								"cardDescription" : "My father hated maps.<br/><br/>\n“And do you know why I hate maps?” he asked me.<br/><br/>\nI didn’t answer.  Not immediately.  With Father, every question was vast, particularly those that looked simple.  And simple questions deserved as much insight and wisdom as could be brought to bear.<br/><br/>\nWith that in mind, I said nothing.<br/><br/>\nWhy would my father hate maps?<br/><br/>\nOne of his collaborators came into the office.  Father didn’t have employees.  Or assistants.  And for that matter, he didn’t have heroes either.  Every person, living or lost, was a collaborator, and that included his children.<br/><br/>\n“Clovis,” said the visitor.<br/><br/>\nFather heard the woman, but he was watching me.<br/><br/>\nThe woman was pretty, and I was sixteen.  So I looked at her, smiling enough for both of us.  And she threw an appreciative wink my way as she described test results from the last five billion runs of our AI Initiative.<br/><br/>\nOut on the Martian desert, my father and picked collaborators were building housing too cold for this universe and too swift to be real.<br/><br/>\nAnd I was a sixteen year-old boy smiling at a pretty woman.<br/><br/>\nMy father thanked her for the update, and she left.<br/><br/>\nJust as I feared, he never looked away from me.<br/><br/>\n“I don’t know why you hate maps,” I admitted.<br/><br/>\nWith Father, ignorance was never the worst crime.  What was awful was pretending to have insight and wisdom where neither existed.<br/><br/>\n“Maps end,” he said.<br/><br/>\nI nodded, just a little.<br/><br/>\n“Maps insist on having borders and edges or the table falls away.  Which isn’t the way the universe works.”<br/><br/>\n“It doesn’t, no,” I agreed.<br/><br/>\nThen he asked me, “So how does the universe work?”<br/><br/>\nI pretended to take my time, considering various smart answers.  But I ended up using my first impulse.<br/><br/>\n“Effortlessly,” I said.<br/><br/>\nHe laughed.  Which wasn’t uncommon for my father, but it was heartening to hear just then.<br/><br/>\n“What else can you tell me?” he asked.<br/><br/>\n“The universe is infinite and probably in multiple ways,” I said.  Then I listed a few examples:  The census of stars, the Many-Worlds principle in quantum mechanics, and the endless measure of tiny realms hiding inside every grain of Martian sand.<br/><br/>\nFather nodded.<br/><br/>\nThe smile died.<br/><br/>\nThen he said something ominous.  Although I didn’t appreciate it at the time.<br/><br/>\n“The universe is someone’s map,” he said.<br/><br/>\n“Is it?” I muttered.<br/><br/>\n“Yes, oh yes.  And what we’re doing here... we’re reaching beyond the boundaries, out into the unknown.  And we pull back new colors to put on this map that can never, ever let itself be finished.”<br/><br/>\nI nodded, smiling like the good son.<br/><br/>\nBut I was sixteen, and my thoughts were mostly about the pretty woman who had winked at me.",

As the last spark vanished, Mara saw darkness once again, a long, stretching, empty darkness—and then another cloud of  sparks burst forth. These were smaller than the others, their tiny flames guttering and flickering, and there were fewer of them too, but Mara inhaled and the sparks rushed toward her, growing bigger as they flew.<br/><br/>\n&quot;We should have stayed in the Reef...&quot; &quot;...Says there&#39;s one city left...&quot; &quot;A City beneath the Traveler...&quot; &quot;At least we&#39;re not in the Reef...&quot; The voices broke over Mara like a wave and for a moment she spun in the currents.<br/><br/>\nNow, in the flames, shapes began to form.

Beltrik the Veiled [HVT R3] and loyal spaceborne elements have been localized to 19 Fortuna. Beltrik is chief Wolf strategist. Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are resupplying ether and performing high-tempo logistical operations. Recon elements and COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll one ship at a time into the resupply pocket while holding all other assets to screen.<br/><br/>\n2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3 spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation of spaceborne assets and capture/nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL HAND.<br/><br/>\n2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly. We will exploit this expectation. Fragment orders follow.<br/><br/>\n3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF 4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will receive missile and torpedo assets to force VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual CIWS/ESM support.<br/><br/>\n3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize FORCECON.<br/><br/>\n4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette. Tinette is on close approach with 19 Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will perform recon denial against VEIL HAND scouts.<br/><br/>\n4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF 4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***. TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette&#39;s shadow as it retrajectorizes for intercept.<br/><br/>\n5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of 687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF 4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be critically degraded and all targets will be maneuvering away from mutual support. Skirmishers and air wing will provide TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR assets will isolate hostile heavy warships from C4I and spoof bad datalinks. Main combatants will cripple VEIL HAND heavy warships and board where opportune.<br/><br/>\n6. NO HARBINGER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.<br/><br/>\n7. Good luck.

								"cardDescription" : "Didn&#39;t anyone tell you about the Prison of Elders? Weren&#39;t you on the strike team that killed that Archon Priest, the one who escaped? Okay, okay, I&#39;ll tell the story about the Prison of Elders...<br/><br/>\nThe Awoken will tell you that a long time ago the Queen conquered the House of Wolves. What they won&#39;t say, because they are very serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos Clash and I wasn&#39;t anywhere near it, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!<br/><br/>\nPretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill all my friends and then myself. Anyway.<br/><br/>\nEveryone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become so strong that they&#39;d be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own forces dry doing someone else&#39;s dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And who&#39;s the best at cutthroat politics? That&#39;s right, her Majesty, the Queen of the Reef.<br/><br/>\nAt the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so! She&#39;d just used them against each other and won absolute control of the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn&#39;t about to just toss away her playing pieces.<br/><br/>\nShe kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobility— all kinds of beasts, captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don&#39;t understand. There&#39;s a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.<br/><br/>\nBut I hear there&#39;s been a few prison breaks. Some old Kell got the old House of Wolves back together.<br/><br/>\nNow, she&#39;s started to wake up her captives. Variks is inviting Guardians out to the Reef to do battle with them in an arena—show valor, earn rewards. It&#39;s been their Crucible. Maybe the Queen wants her collection thinned out. Maybe the Queen wants Guardians in the Reef, to deter more unrest. Maybe the Queen wants intelligence on how her prizes fight.<br/><br/>\nMaybe she wants intelligence on how WE fight.<br/><br/>\nWhatever happens— I want you to remember that she knows, more than anyone else I&#39;ve met, how to set one foe against another.",

With the House of Wolves in disarray, the Queen needs muscle in the Reef. Guardians go where the treasure and the glory are, and an arena of champions is a wonderful place to earn both. Guardians in the Reef deter threats to the Queen and give the Awoken a chance to learn about their power and subvert their loyalty to the Traveler. And if, as the Queen worries, the Nine are scheming against her, then she needs a good excuse to clear out some of the most dangerous prizes in the Prison of Elders.<br/><br/>\nAnd the Prison of Elders is full of dangerous prizes. The Awoken have captured titanically dangerous specimens from everywhere in the inner solar system. These monstrous champions want to smash Guardian bone and Guardian alloy—and given the chance, they&#39;ll kill Guardians, rend their Ghosts, and snuff them out forever. Walk into the arena with a Fireteam you trust. And beware: the agents of the Nine are active in the Reef, and their curiosity is as limitless as it is inscrutable.<br/><br/>\nRisk death.

Survivor of the great disaster: the day we set out to retake our moon, united in a host of thousands, and found ourselves outmatched by one Hive champion of unspeakable power.<br/><br/>\nThe monster&#39;s name is Crota. He killed my friends face to face, one by one, and he relished it. In the name of all those lost I devote myself to his utter destruction.<br/><br/>\nThis is my confession. If I transgress in your eyes I ask for your forgiveness.<br/><br/>\nIn our world Crota seemed invincible. Together Eris Morn and I worked the problem, but found no hope. So we sought forbidden knowledge—the exiled master of Hive arcana.<br/><br/>\nWe found Toland.<br/><br/>\nToland tells us that Crota&#39;s presence in our world is a shadow. That its true power resides in a netherworld forged by his will. We must pass through a keyhole between realities, navigate the seething midnight of Crota&#39;s world-mind, and overthrow the ascendant champions that gather to his throne.<br/><br/>\nToland speaks—he hardly seems mad, at times—of the terrible things that await us. A secret song he hungers to learn, and the issue of that song, an ashen burning star-husk that looms above, the utter antithesis of life. He talks of it with a curious ambition I do not want to understand.<br/><br/>\nTomorrow I will ask Agah, Mota and Tarlowe if they will go with us. If we fail, I leave this record for Guardians to come. Remember us.",

I like this name.<br/><br/>\nLet me give you a gift, Eris. Let me tell you about the power in the logic of the sword:<br/><br/>\nA Shredder or a Boomer is a powerful weapon, but it kills acyclically. You see? It sends out harm and it takes nothing back. The bolt passes away into nothing. A sword, though, a sword is like a bridge, a crossing-point. The sword binds wielder to victim. It binds life to death. And when the binding is done—the sword remembers. When the Boomer&#39;s fire has burnt away into axion and neutrino scatter, the sword goes on, hungrier and sharper.<br/><br/>\nUnderstand that this nightmare logic underpins His nightmare world, and you will see why the ascendant blade has so much power there. Whenever in our passage we find ourselves in need of power—remember that the greatest authority here is a blade made keen by eons of use.<br/><br/>\nThis is the world the Hive craves: a universe creased by the edge of the sharpest sword.",

How did you take (or rather, un-Take) the Blighted Light that Oryx gathered to offer in sacrifice to Akka, and ignite it so that it burned and burned the Darkness?<br/><br/>\nIt was barely Light anymore.
